## 1. Template Adherence Rules

### 1.0 Pre-generation Batch Read

**Hard rule**: Before the first SVG page, batch-read every template SVG this deck will reference. Read once up front, never re-read during generation.

| Source list | Read path |
|---|---|
| Chosen template's `design_spec.md` (read frontmatter to detect `replication_mode`) | `templates/design_spec.md` |
| Every distinct `<basename>` in `spec_lock.md page_layouts` | `templates/<basename>.svg` |
| Every distinct chart name in `spec_lock.md page_charts` | `templates/charts/<chart_name>.svg` |
| Chart types in `design_spec.md §VII` not covered above | `templates/charts/<chart_name>.svg` |

**Default — read each template once; re-read only on the mid-deck exception below**:
- Layout SVG already loaded in this batch
- Chart SVG already loaded in this batch

`spec_lock.md` is the only file re-read per page (§2.1).

**Exception**: user mid-deck adds pages or swaps templates introducing a basename/chart absent from the original batch → read the new file once, continue.

> Note: batched prefix reads stay in the cached prompt prefix; per-page `spec_lock.md` re-reads append below and benefit from that cache. Scattered on-demand reads of layout/chart SVGs would invalidate downstream cache and sit in the compression-vulnerable mid-context region.

Resolve the per-page template SVG via `spec_lock.md page_layouts` (authoritative). The legacy page-type table below is a **last-resort fallback** for legacy decks where `page_layouts` is missing.

**Resolution order (per page):**

1. **Mirror-mode template** (template's `design_spec.md` frontmatter has `replication_mode: mirror`) → see §1.1 below. The page is consumed as a **visual reference**, not as a placeholder shell.
2. `spec_lock.md page_layouts` has `P<NN>: <basename>` for this page → inherit the structure of `templates/<basename>.svg` (already in context from §1.0).
3. `page_layouts` exists but **no entry** for this page → **free design**, no template inheritance.
4. `page_layouts` section absent (legacy deck) **and** `templates/` directory exists → fall back to the page-type table below, matching by SVG filename keyword (cover/chapter/content/ending/toc). Read the matched file at first use if §1.0 batch did not cover it.
5. No template at all → free design.

> Note: `page_layouts` disambiguates the multiple content variants modern templates ship (e.g., `graduation_defense` has 8); the legacy table cannot.

**Templates supply structure, not skin (non-mirror)**: a chart or layout template's gradients, drop-shadows, palette, **and font sizes** are placeholder. Inherit its geometry, label / legend placement, and series-encoding logic; re-skin every fill / stroke to the deck's `visual_style` + `spec_lock.colors` — flat styles strip the gradients and shadows, gradient / glass styles repaint their own. Forbidden — shipping a template's default `<linearGradient>` / `cardShadow` / Tailwind fills unchanged. Mirror templates are the exception: §1.1 preserves their visuals verbatim.

**Font size is skin, not geometry (non-mirror).** A chart / layout template's hardcoded `font-size` values (often 11–16px, sized for the template's own dense placeholder text) are NOT inherited — classify each text into its `spec_lock.md` role and use that role's locked size, exactly as you re-skin color. **Structural roles (page title / body / subtitle / annotation / footnote) hold their one deck-wide size on every page** — the template's placeholder px never overrides it; same-role text drifting page to page is what makes a deck look unprofessional.

**Typography execution order (mandatory):**

1. Build a per-page text inventory from `design_spec.md §IX` + the current `notes/<NN>_*.md`.
2. Classify each text item before drawing. **Structural roles** (`title`, `subtitle` / `lead`, `body`, `annotation`, `footnote` / `page_number`) must map to their declared `spec_lock.typography` slot. A **one-off feature element** (a single hero number, an isolated emphasis label) may take an in-ramp intermediate value — the ramp is anchored on `body`, not a closed menu — but a feature size that **recurs** must be promoted to a declared slot. The failure mode this guards against is structural text silently inheriting the template's compact px, not legitimate feature sizing.
3. Copy the role's locked px value into `font-size` verbatim. Do this before placing the text; never start from a template `font-size` and then "adjust".
4. Layout from those locked sizes: compute line-height, wrapped line count, child `y` / `dy`, card padding, card height, column gaps, and available image/chart area from the chosen px values.
5. Only after this reflow may you inspect fit. If fit fails, move / resize containers or simplify local geometry first; do not reduce the role size merely because the inherited template slot was smaller.

**Geometry adapts to the type, never the reverse**: when the locked size is larger than the template's placeholder text, widen / heighten the card, open spacing, and recompute child `y` / `dy` to make room — do not shrink the font to fit the inherited container. A `font-size` change is a layout change: revise line-height and every downstream vertical coordinate that depends on it. For wrapped text, allocate at least the wrapped line count × line-height plus top / bottom padding; fixed `y` stacks copied from a smaller template are invalid once the locked role size is applied. The Executor renders the page it was given; page count and per-page density are the Strategist's call, fixed at confirmation — do **not** re-paginate, split the page, or drop authored content to cope with size here. Only when a single block still cannot fit after the geometry is fully reflowed may you shrink **that block** as a bounded last resort — and **only body text** is ever shrunk this way. Title, subtitle, annotation / caption, footnote and page number are **locked once set and never adjusted to fit** — their values hold across the whole deck. Step the overflowing body block's `font-size` down by `2`px at a time, and only if it still overflows step it down again, up to a cumulative floor of **`4`px below the locked body size** (e.g. `24` → no smaller than `20`). This is a **local, single-block** reduction — the deck-wide locked body size is unchanged on every other block and page. (The Executor works in **unitless px** throughout — spec_lock and SVG carry no `pt`.) If the block still overflows at the floor, surface a `warning:` rather than silently restructure the page. (Mirror templates are the exception: §1.1 preserves their sizes verbatim — there the source deck's typography *is* the spec.)

### 1.1 Mirror-mode templates — reference-style consumption

When the project's chosen template is a `mirror` template (`design_spec.md` frontmatter declares `replication_mode: mirror`), Executor switches to a **reference-style** consumption path that bypasses placeholder substitution:

1. **Per-page reference selection** — Strategist selects one mirror page per project page via `spec_lock.md page_layouts` (e.g., `P04: 015_content`). The basename is the mirror filename without extension; Strategist made this choice by reading `design_spec.md §V Page Roster` descriptions, not by guessing.
2. **Copy, don't fill** — open the referenced mirror SVG (already in context from §1.0). **Copy it as the starting point for the project page**, then edit text elements in place to express the project's content for `P<NN>`. Preserve every non-text element verbatim: backgrounds, decorative shapes, sprite-cropped images, charts, icon usage, color values, font families, geometry, sprite `<svg viewBox>` wrappers, and **which image** each `<image>` points at.
3. **What you may edit** — the visible text content of `<text>` / `<tspan>` elements that express slide-specific content (title, body, captions, KPI labels, dates, page numbers). Replace the source deck's example text with the project's text for this page from `design_spec.md §IX` and `notes/<NN>_*.md`.
4. **What you must not touch** — element positions, sizes, fonts, colors, fills, strokes, gradients, **which image each `<image>` points at**, `<g>` grouping, sprite-sheet `<svg viewBox>` wrappers, decorative `<rect>` / `<path>` / `<circle>` / `<polygon>` shapes, `<use data-icon="...">` markers, embedded chart data structures. Mirror's value is preserving the source deck's visual identity — any geometric / decorative drift defeats the purpose. **The `href` path is not the image**: normalizing a bare `href="cover_bg.png"` to `href="../images/<name>"` (when Step 3 relocated the asset to `images/`) points at the *same* image and changes nothing visual — that is an allowed path fix, not a fidelity edit. Leaving the bare href as-is is also fine; the exporter and live preview resolve bare hrefs against `images/` either way.
5. **Content fit** — the mirror page was chosen by Strategist because its layout matches the content slot. If the project's content for `P<NN>` legitimately needs more / fewer items than the mirror page provides (e.g. mirror shows 3 KPI cards, project has 4 metrics), keep the mirror page's visual rhythm and either drop one metric to fit or split across two pages — do **not** restructure the mirror page's grid. If neither works, surface a `warning: P<NN> content does not fit mirror reference <basename>; suggest different reference page` and proceed with the closest-fit edit.
6. **No `{{}}` substitution** — mirror SVGs do not contain placeholder markers. Do not search for `{{TITLE}}` / `{{CONTENT_AREA}}` etc.; do not invent placeholders. The whole mirror contract is "verbatim source + in-place text edit".
7. **Output filename** — follow the standard project SVG naming convention (`<NN>_<page_name>.svg` where `<NN>` matches the project page index, not the mirror source index). The mirror filename is the *reference*, not the *output*.

**Detecting mirror mode**: read the chosen template's `design_spec.md` frontmatter once during §1.0 batch read. If `replication_mode: mirror`, every page that hits `page_layouts` follows §1.1 above; pages without a `page_layouts` entry still fall through to free design (resolution rule 3 above).

**Mirror + chart pages**: chart structures inside a mirror SVG are already drawn (axis, series, labels). Treat them as visual references — replace the data labels and series text content to match the project's chart spec, but do not redraw the chart from a `templates/charts/<name>.svg` baseline. A mirror template's `page_charts` entries are normally absent for this reason.

**Legacy fallback table** (used only when `page_layouts` is absent):

| Page Type | Corresponding Template | Adherence Rules |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Cover | `01_cover.svg` | Inherit background, decorative elements, layout structure; replace placeholder content |
| Chapter | `02_chapter.svg` | Inherit numbering style, title position, decorative elements |
| Content | `03_content.svg` | Inherit header/footer styles; **content area may be freely laid out** |
| Ending | `04_ending.svg` | Inherit background, thank-you message position, contact info layout |
| TOC | `02_toc.svg` | **Optional**: Inherit TOC title, list styles |

### Page-Template Mapping Declaration (Required Output)

Before generating each page, output which template is used:

```
📝 **Template mapping**: `templates/03a_content_image_text.svg` (or "None (free design)")
🎯 **Adherence rules / layout strategy**: [specific description]
```

- **Content pages**: template defines only header/footer; content area is free
- **No template**: generate entirely per the Design Spec

---

## 2. Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory Step)

Before the first SVG page, output a confirmation listing: canvas dimensions, body font size, color scheme (primary/secondary/accent HEX), font plan. Prevents spec/execution drift.

### 2.1 Per-page spec_lock re-read (Mandatory)

> Long decks drift off the declared palette/icons mid-deck due to context compression. `spec_lock.md` is the canonical execution reference — re-read it per page to bypass model memory.

**Hard rule**: Before generating **each** SVG page, `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md`. Use only values from this file, not from memory. If context was auto-compacted, also `read_file <project_path>/design_spec.md` for the current page's §IX brief.

**Per-block expression**: render each `design_spec.md §IX Content` block in its written texture — a full-sentence block as wrapped prose, a fragment/label block as bullets/keywords. **Never split a full-sentence block into a bullet list** — splitting loses the information that the block was continuous reasoning, not a set of parallel points; not because a bullet lays out easier, and not because an inherited template slot is shaped as a list. If a block carries no clear texture, infer the mode from its wording and the page layout.

- **Prose render recipe**: one `<text>` per paragraph; wrap lines with sibling `<tspan>` that reset `x` to the block's left edge and advance `dy` by the font size × a line-height factor. **Default — line-height by density (may override per content fit)**: ~1.4–1.5× for dense / small-body blocks (CLReq comfortable minimum), 1.6–2.0× for large-type, sparse, or `breathing` blocks. Fit about width ÷ font-size CJK glyphs per line (Latin fits roughly twice that); the last line runs short. Use the body ramp size, not a new one.
- **Template precedence**: when an inherited template slot is a bullet list but the §IX block is prose, the prose wins — widen or reflow the container to hold the paragraph, or drop that card; do not pour the sentence back into the list slot.
- **Mode precedence**: the locked mode shapes voice / register, not §IX's authored titles or page order. When a `§IX` title is a user-authored topic label, keep it — do not upgrade it to an assertion just because the mode (e.g. `pyramid`) favors them; mode title-tendencies apply only to AI-drafted titles.

> Note: block-level phrasing, applied *within* the page's `page_rhythm` density (below), not against it.

**If `spec_lock.md` is missing**: emit `warning: spec_lock.md missing — generating without execution lock` once, then proceed using `design_spec.md` values. Expected only for legacy projects; new projects MUST have it (see [strategist.md](strategist.md) §6 step 4).

**Forbidden — values outside the lock**:

- Colors (fill / stroke / stop-color) MUST come from `colors`
- Icons MUST come from `icons.inventory`; library MUST equal `icons.library`
- Font family from `typography`: use role override (`title_family` / `body_family` / `emphasis_family` / `code_family`) if declared, else fall back to `font_family`
- Font sizes follow a **ramp anchored on `typography.body`**, not a closed menu. **Structural roles — page title, body, subtitle, annotation / caption, footnote / page number — render at one consistent size deck-wide, taken from their `spec_lock` slot; never re-pick a structural role's size page by page or carry a template's placeholder px.** This locks the **role**, not every glyph: a page may still carry deliberate typographic hierarchy — a lead-in sentence, an inline emphasis figure, a pull-quote, a kicker, a hero number — but each of those is its **own role / feature element** with its own size, **applied consistently deck-wide** (declare a recurring one as its own `spec_lock` slot). In-band intermediate sizes are for exactly these feature elements. What is banned is the *same* role drifting size to fit a container or by page whim — that scatter is what reads as unprofessional. Sizes outside every band require extending the lock first.
- **The page's core message is primary — render it ≥ `body`.** The one-idea / key-claim / key-takeaway line a page is built around is its most important text; map it to the locked `lead` or `subtitle` slot (≥ `body`), never to a sub-`body` size. Demoting it below body while data callouts or labels sit larger inverts the hierarchy — the failure this prevents. If no `lead` / `subtitle` slot is locked for a recurring core-message line, surface it (per below) instead of improvising a smaller one. A footnote / page number / source credit uses the locked `footnote` (or `annotation`) slot — never an invented sub-`annotation` size; and the body-shrink last resort (§1.0) bottoms out at `body − 4`px, a hard floor never crossed.
- **Write the locked px verbatim; at most 2 decimals.** `font-size` MUST be the exact px from `spec_lock.typography` — if `body` is `24`, write `24`; never substitute a "rounder" or PowerPoint-familiar number (`20` / `18` / `36`). The system is px-only — there is no pt to convert, and a remembered pt-style value written as px renders the whole deck the wrong size. Prefer whole numbers (sizes are clean even px); keep a decimal only for a slot that genuinely carries one in `spec_lock`. Never emit long tails like `20.8026`: the exporter rounds the final size to 1 decimal pt, so extra px precision is wasted noise.
- Images MUST reference files listed under `images`; no invented filenames
- Formula PNGs are images with `Acquire Via: formula` / `Status: Rendered`; place them only from the listed file path and never recreate the formula as text.

If a page needs a value not in `spec_lock.md`, surface it — do not silently invent one.

**Per-page layout rhythm — `page_rhythm` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_rhythm` (key format `P<NN>` matching the page index in §IX of `design_spec.md`) and apply the corresponding layout discipline:

| Tag | Layout discipline |
|-----|-------------------|
| `anchor` | Structural page (cover / chapter / TOC / ending). With a template, follow the matching template verbatim. In free design (no template), realize the page's §IX intent — for the cover deliver its `Cover impact` and for a closing page its `Closing impact` (the committed hook / takeaway + composition), never a default centered title + subtitle or a generic "Thank you" sign-off. |
| `dense` | Information-heavy. Card grids, multi-column layouts, KPI dashboards, tables, and charts are all permitted. This is the baseline behavior. |
| `breathing` | Low-density impact page. Avoid **multi-card grid layouts** — do not organize content as multiple parallel rounded containers (3-card row, 4-card KPI grid, 2×2 matrix rendered as cards). Use naked text blocks, dividers, whitespace, or full-bleed imagery as the content structure. Single rounded visual elements (hero image corners, callouts, tags, one emphasis block) are fine — the rule is about grid structure, not about the `rx` attribute. Proportions follow information weight (not a preset ratio). Typical forms: hero quote, single large number with one-line interpretation, full-bleed image with floating caption, section transition. |

> Without rhythm variation, every page defaults to card grids (the "AI-generated" look). `page_rhythm` is the only narrative lever that survives context compression.

**Missing `page_rhythm` section** → emit `warning: spec_lock.md missing page_rhythm — defaulting all pages to dense` once, fall back to `dense` for all pages.

**Tag not found for current page** → emit `warning: spec_lock.md page_rhythm tag not found for P<NN> — falling back to dense` once per deck (aggregate; do not repeat per page), fall back to `dense`. Do not invent a tag.

**Per-page template lookup — `page_layouts` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_layouts` to decide which basename to inherit (the SVG itself was loaded in §1.0):

- Entry present (e.g., `P04: 03a_content_image_text`) → inherit the corresponding SVG already in context. The basename **must match** an actual file in the chosen template directory; if it doesn't, emit `warning: page_layouts P<NN> references missing file <basename>.svg — falling back to free design` and proceed.
- No entry for this page → free design, no inheritance. **Not an error** — Strategist intentionally left this page free.
- Whole section absent → see §1 fallback (legacy page-type matching).

Do **not** invent a layout entry, and do **not** assume a template just because `templates/` exists — if `page_layouts` is present but silent for this page, that silence is the instruction.

**Per-page chart reference — `page_charts` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_charts` to decide which chart structure applies (the SVG itself was loaded in §1.0):

- Entry present (e.g., `P09: timeline_horizontal`) → adapt the corresponding chart SVG already in context. Apply project colors/typography/density; do not copy verbatim. Cross-reference `templates/charts/charts_index.json` for the chart's purpose summary if needed.
- No entry for this page → either no chart on this page, or a chart that didn't match any catalog template (Strategist's `no-template-match` fallback). Design the visualization from scratch using `design_spec.md §VII` for guidance.
- Whole section absent → no chart pages in this deck.

## 3. Execution Guidelines

- **Proximity**: group related elements with tight spacing; separate unrelated groups
- **Spec adherence**: follow color, layout, canvas format, and typography in the spec
- **Template structure**: if templates exist, inherit the visual framework
- **Main-agent ownership**: SVG generation must run in the main agent (not sub-agents) — pages share upstream context for cross-page visual continuity
- **Generation rhythm**: lock global design context first, then generate pages sequentially in one continuous context. No batched groups (e.g., 5 at a time).
- **Phased batch generation** (recommended):
  1. **Visual Construction Phase**: generate all SVG pages sequentially for visual consistency. Use layout judgment for chart marks during the draft. **MUST embed plot-area markers** per §3.1 below on every chart page — coordinate calibration is a post-generation step (see [`workflows/verify-charts.md`](../workflows/verify-charts.md)) that depends on these markers.
  2. **Quality Check Gate**: run `python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>` on `svg_output/`. Any `error` (banned features, viewBox mismatch, spec_lock drift, non-PPT-safe font, etc.) MUST be fixed on the offending page before proceeding — regenerate and re-check. Address `warning`s when straightforward. Do NOT defer to after `finalize_svg.py` — finalize rewrites SVG and masks some violations.
  3. **Logic Construction Phase**: after SVGs pass the quality check, batch-generate speaker notes for narrative continuity.

### 3.1 Chart Plot-Area Marker (MANDATORY on every chart page)

> The [`verify-charts`](../workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow enumerates chart pages from `design_spec.md §VII`, then reads each page's plot-area marker to feed `svg_position_calculator.py`. Missing marker → verify-charts has to re-derive the plot area from axis lines, paying the cost on every run.

**Hard rule**: every SVG page that contains a data visualization chart includes a plot-area marker inside `<g id="chartArea">`, placed **after axis lines** and **before the first data element** (bar, line, area, point).

**Rectangular plot area** (bar / horizontal_bar / grouped_bar / stacked_bar / line / area / stacked_area / scatter / waterfall / pareto / butterfly):

```xml
<!-- chart-plot-area: x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max -->
```

**Radial charts** (pie / donut / radar):

```xml
<!-- chart-plot-area: pie | center: cx,cy | radius: r -->
<!-- chart-plot-area: donut | center: cx,cy | outer-radius: r1 | inner-radius: r2 -->
<!-- chart-plot-area: radar | center: cx,cy | radius: r -->
```

**How to determine coordinate values**:

| Value | Derivation |
|-------|------------|
| `x_min` | X coordinate of the Y-axis line (leftmost data boundary) |
| `y_min` | Y coordinate of the topmost grid line (highest data boundary) |
| `x_max` | X coordinate of the rightmost axis endpoint or grid line |
| `y_max` | Y coordinate of the X-axis baseline |
| `cx, cy` | Center point of pie/donut/radar (accounting for `transform="translate()"`) |
| `r` | Outer radius of the chart |

**Per-page verification** — after writing each chart SVG, confirm the marker exists:

```bash
grep "chart-plot-area" <project_path>/svg_output/<current_page>.svg
```

> All chart templates in `templates/charts/` include this marker as a reference. If you are drawing a chart and the marker is absent, you have a bug.
- **Technical specs**: see [shared-standards.md](shared-standards.md) for SVG/PPT constraints
- **Card containers — use the documented patterns**: when a content page needs section cards (4 quadrants, parallel aspects, capability blocks, info cards), use the patterns codified in [`templates/charts/CHART_STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../templates/charts/CHART_STYLE_GUIDE.md) §11 — half-rounded section tab (§11.1), nested card border without stroke (§11.2), card-grid skeletons (§11.3), diagonal dashed connector for cross-quadrant relationships (§11.5), ground-anchor ellipse as a non-filter depth marker (§11.6), bidirectional interaction arrows for paired protocols (§11.7). Do not reinvent the "tinted full-rounded rect + white cover-rect to hide the bottom corners" hack; it survives in older templates but breaks SVG→PPTX color editing. Reference templates: [`labeled_card.svg`](../templates/charts/labeled_card.svg), [`quadrant_text_bullets.svg`](../templates/charts/quadrant_text_bullets.svg), [`kpi_cards.svg`](../templates/charts/kpi_cards.svg), [`matrix_2x2.svg`](../templates/charts/matrix_2x2.svg), [`team_roster.svg`](../templates/charts/team_roster.svg), [`client_server_flow.svg`](../templates/charts/client_server_flow.svg).
- **Reference — prefer semantic shapes over preset stacks (not a constraint)**: when a slide needs to express "ascending / converging / breaking through / stacking" — i.e., a relationship that goes beyond a generic arrow — prefer a single custom `<polygon>` or `<path>` that encodes the semantics geometrically, rather than stacking multiple preset arrows. A converging-tip path or a podium polygon reads faster than three arrows pointing at a label. Examples of this technique appear in many imported corporate decks; see `projects/01_template_import/svg_output/slide_01.svg` shape-158 for a reference (gradient-filled inward-pointing arrow). Do not codify these as templates — they are page-specific; the rule is just "consider polygon before stacking presets."
- **Reference — visual depth through restraint (not a constraint)**: layered depth comes from rhythm (flat vs lifted, dense vs spacious), not from shadows everywhere. Shadow typically suits 2-3 genuinely floating elements per page (cards on photos, primary CTA, overlays); keep peer-grid cards, dividers, body containers flat. Reach for typography weight, spacing, accent bars, subtle tints **before** shadow. Full rules in shared-standards.md §6.

### SVG File Naming Convention

Format: `<NN>_<page_name>.svg` (two-digit number from 01; name matches the deck's language and the page title in the Design Spec).

Examples: `01_封面.svg` / `02_目录.svg` / `03_核心优势.svg`; `01_cover.svg` / `02_agenda.svg` / `03_key_benefits.svg`.

## 4. Icon Usage

Strategist chooses the library and inventory; Executor only implements. Library details and one-library rule: [`../templates/icons/README.md`](../templates/icons/README.md). This section defines placeholder syntax.

> **Resolution is project-first.** Strategist copied the chosen icons into `<project_path>/icons/<lib>/` (via `icon_sync.py`); `finalize_svg.py embed-icons` embeds from there, falling back to the global library per-icon. **Custom icons**: drop an `.svg` into `<project_path>/icons/<lib>/` (any `<lib>`, e.g. `custom/`) and reference it as `data-icon="<lib>/<name>"` — it embeds like any other. Reference only icons in the `spec_lock.md` inventory.

**Built-in icons — Placeholder method (recommended)**:

```xml
<!-- chunk-filled (straight-line geometry, sharp corners, structured) -->
<use data-icon="chunk-filled/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- tabler-filled (bezier-curve forms, smooth & rounded contours) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-filled/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- tabler-outline (light, line-art style — screen-only decks) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- phosphor-duotone (single color + 20% backplate — soft depth without solid weight) -->
<use data-icon="phosphor-duotone/house" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- simple-icons (brand logos — used alongside the deck's primary library, only for real company/product marks) -->
<use data-icon="simple-icons/github" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#181717"/>

<!-- tabler-outline with thin / bold stroke (stroke-style libraries only) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587" stroke-width="1.5"/>
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587" stroke-width="3"/>
```

> ⚠️ **Color**: ALWAYS use `fill="#HEX"` on `<use data-icon="...">`. NEVER use `stroke` or `fill="none"`, even for stroke-style libraries.
>
> **stroke-width** (stroke-style libraries only, currently `tabler-outline`): allowed values `{1.5, 2, 3}`. If `spec_lock.md icons.stroke_width` is declared, all placeholders MUST use that value deck-wide. Default `2` if absent (legacy). Ignored on non-stroke libraries.
>
> Icons are auto-embedded by `finalize_svg.py` — no need to run `embed_icons.py` manually.

**Searching for icons** — use terminal, zero token cost:
```bash
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/chunk-filled/ | grep home
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/tabler-filled/ | grep home
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/tabler-outline/ | grep chart
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/phosphor-duotone/ | grep house
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/simple-icons/ | grep github
```

**Abstract concept → icon name** (names for `chunk-filled`; tabler libraries use their own equivalents — verify with `ls | grep`):

| Concept | chunk-filled | tabler-filled / tabler-outline |
|---------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Growth / Increase | `arrow-trend-up` | same |

## 5. Visualization Reference

Chart SVGs referenced in **VII. Visualization Reference List** are loaded once via the §1.0 batch read. This section governs adaptation only.

**Hard rule**: adapt the loaded chart SVG; do not improvise from memory and do not replicate verbatim. Apply project colors, typography, content; preserve visualization type.

**Adaptation rules**:
- **Preserve**: visualization type (bar/line/pie/timeline/process/framework…) as specified
- **Adapt**: data, labels, colors (project scheme), dimensions
- **Freely adjust**: composition, axis ranges, grid, legend, spacing, decoration — as long as the chart stays accurate and readable
- **Forbidden**: changing visualization type without spec justification; omitting data points or structural elements from the outline

> Templates: `templates/charts/` (70 types). Index: `templates/charts/charts_index.json`

### 5.1 Chart Coordinate Calibration

Coordinate calibration runs as a **standalone post-generation workflow**, not inside the executor pipeline. After SVG generation completes, if the deck contains data charts, run [`workflows/verify-charts.md`](../workflows/verify-charts.md) before post-processing.

The executor's only obligation here is upstream: embed the `<!-- chart-plot-area ... -->` marker on every chart page during initial draft (§3.1). Verify-charts enumerates chart pages from `design_spec.md §VII` (authoritative deck plan) and uses the marker to feed `svg_position_calculator.py`.

> Do NOT run `svg_position_calculator.py` during the initial draft. The calculator calibrates already-generated SVGs against their declared plot areas; running it before the SVG exists has nothing to compare against.

## 6. Image Handling

Handle images by their status in the Design Spec's Image Resource List. Status enum and lifecycle: [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

| Status | Source | Handling |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Existing** | User-provided | Reference images directly from `../images/` directory |
| **Generated** | Generated by Image_Generator | Reference images directly from `../images/` directory |
| **Sourced** | Web-acquired by Image_Searcher | Reference from `../images/`. **Read [`image_sources.json`](image-searcher.md) to decide attribution** — see §6.1 below. |
| **Rendered** | Deterministic formula PNG | Reference from `../images/`; use `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"` |
| **Needs-Manual** | Acquisition failed and file is absent | Use dashed border placeholder unless the expected file exists |
| **Placeholder** | Not yet prepared | Use dashed border placeholder |

**Reference syntax**: see [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

**Template-bundled images**: when a template (deck / layout / brand) is applied, its bitmaps are copied into the project's `images/` alongside every other runtime image (SKILL.md Step 3). Reference them the same way — `../images/<name>` — and do **not** reproduce a template SVG's bare sibling href (e.g. `href="cover_bg.png"`): the template SVG is reference material, the rendered page lives in `svg_output/` and must point at `../images/`. Mirror templates (§1.1) are the one exception — they copy hrefs verbatim, and the exporter resolves those bare hrefs against `images/`.

**Placeholder**: Dashed border `<rect stroke-dasharray="8,4" .../>` + description text

**`no-crop` images**: when a `spec_lock.md images` entry ends with ` | no-crop`, size the container to the image's native ratio (from `analyze_images.py` or file dims) and use `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`. Untagged entries are croppable — default to `slice`.

**Formula images**: rows with `Acquire Via: formula` or `Type: Latex Formula` MUST be treated as no-crop even if a legacy `spec_lock.md` forgot the flag. Use the dimensions from `design_spec.md §VIII`, `analysis/image_analysis.csv`, or `images/formula_manifest.json`; do not normalize all formulas to one height unless the spec explicitly states that layout choice.

### 6.1 Inline Attribution for Sourced Images (web path)

Whenever the slide uses an image with `Status: Sourced`, look up the corresponding entry in `project/images/image_sources.json` and act on `license_tier`:

| `license_tier` | Action on this slide |
|---|---|
| `no-attribution` | Embed the `<image>` element only. **No credit element needed.** |
| `attribution-required` | Embed the `<image>` element **plus** a small inline `<text>` credit element per the visual spec in [image-searcher.md §7](./image-searcher.md). |

The credit text is **not** rendered by post-processing or export — it must be present in the SVG you produce. The shape of the credit element (size, position, color, multi-image source line, hero gradient overlay) is specified in [image-searcher.md §7](./image-searcher.md). Do not invent a different style.

Use `attribution_text` from the manifest entry as the **starting point**, then compress for the small-text constraint (drop URL, drop filename, keep "via Provider / License"). For CC0/PD images that landed in the `attribution-required` tier only because of upstream metadata quirks (rare), credits are still safe to render.

`svg_quality_checker.py` treats missing CC BY / CC BY-SA inline attribution as an **error**. Fix the offending SVG before post-processing.

**The manifest is the single source of truth for credits.** Do not duplicate license info into speaker notes or any other artifact.

## 7. Font Usage

Source of truth: `spec_lock.md typography`. Use `font_family` as default; override per role with `title_family` / `body_family` / `emphasis_family` / `code_family` if declared. LaTeX formulas that Strategist rendered are PNG images, not a `code_family` text role.

If `spec_lock.md` is absent, consult [`strategist.md`](strategist.md) §g — do not invent a stack.

**Hard rule**: every SVG `font-family` stack MUST end with a pre-installed family (Microsoft YaHei / SimHei / SimSun / Arial / Calibri / Segoe UI / Times New Roman / Georgia / Consolas / Courier New / Impact / Arial Black). PPTX has no runtime fallback — missing fonts degrade to Calibri.

## 8. Speaker Notes Generation Framework

### Task 1. Generate Complete Speaker Notes Document

After all SVG pages are finalized, enter Logic Construction Phase and write the full notes to `notes/total.md`. Batch-writing (not per-page) lets transitions plan coherently.

**Pure spoken narration**: notes are read aloud verbatim by `notes_to_audio.py` (TTS). Write only what should be spoken. No visible markers, no labeled meta-lines, no enumerated key-point lists, no duration annotations — anything you write outside the heading will be vocalized.

**Per-page structure**: `# <number>_<page_title>` heading (the `#` heading line is the only thing stripped before TTS), pages separated by `---`. Body is 2–5 natural sentences carrying the page's core message. Page-to-page transitions live inside the opening sentence as natural prose ("接下来……" / "Having framed X, let's turn to Y") — no bracketed `[过渡]` / `[Transition]` tags.

**Concrete examples** — same shape applies to any language; just write naturally in that language.

中文 deck：

```
# 02_市场格局

在明确了行业背景之后，我们来看具体的市场格局。当前线上零售集中度持续上升，前三大平台合计份额已经达到百分之六十八，腰部玩家正在被快速挤压，留给新进入者的窗口期不超过十八个月。这意味着我们的策略必须聚焦，而不是铺开。
```

英文 deck：

```
# 02_market_landscape

Having framed the industry backdrop, let's look at the actual market landscape. Online retail concentration keeps rising — the top three platforms now hold sixty-eight percent of combined share, mid-tier players are being squeezed fast, and the window for new entrants is under eighteen months. This means our strategy has to focus, not spread.
```

> 日本語 / 한국어 / 其他语言：照搬同样的结构，用对应语言自然书写即可。

**Number readability**: TTS reads digits and symbols literally. Prefer fully-spelled forms in the language being spoken when literal pronunciation would be awkward (e.g. Chinese "百分之六十八" reads better than "68%"; "1-2分钟" reads as "一减二分钟"). Plain integers and percentages in English are fine as-is.

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- Leaving any bracketed stage marker (`[过渡]` / `[Transition]` / `[Pause]` / `[Data]` / `[Scan Room]` / `[Interactive]` / `[Benchmark]` etc.) in the text — they will be read aloud literally.
- Adding `要点：① …` / `Key points: (1) …` / `时长：2分钟` / `Duration: 2 minutes` / `Flex: …` lines — TTS will speak "要点 一 …".
- Mixing languages within one deck's notes.

### Task 2. Split Into Per-Page Note Files

Auto-split `notes/total.md` into per-page files in `notes/`.

**Naming**: match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`); `slide01.md` also supported (legacy).

## 9. Next Steps After Completion

> **Auto-continuation**: After Visual Construction Phase (all SVG pages) and Logic Construction Phase (all notes) are complete, the Executor proceeds directly to the post-processing pipeline.

**Post-processing & Export** (same canonical pipeline as [shared-standards.md §5](shared-standards.md)):

```bash
# 1. Split speaker notes
python3 scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>

# 2. SVG post-processing (auto-embed icons, images, etc.)
python3 scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>

# 3. Export PPTX
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
# Output (default-flow mode):
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx           ← native pptx (canonical output)
#   backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/                    ← Executor SVG source backup (always written)
#
# Add --svg-snapshot to additionally emit:
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>_svg.pptx      ← SVG snapshot pptx (sibling of native pptx)
```
