# Confirm UI — Eight Confirmations Page

> The interactive, visual surface for SKILL.md Step 4 (the Eight Confirmations). Enumerable fields list **all** options from a catalog with the AI's recommendation badged; generative fields (color, typography, generated-image style) show **≥3** AI candidates (creative recommendations always offer real choice — same rule as the h.5 image strategy; fewer only on the honest-shortfall exception, with a stated reason). Fields whose universe is open (canvas, mode, visual style, icons, image usage) also get a **Custom** box; fully closed fields (AI source when applicable, formula policy, generation mode, refine spec) do not. The AI writes its recommendation to `recommendations.json`; the user's final choices are written back to `result.json` for the AI to read. On confirm the page saves the result and shuts the server down (auto-close). The chat path is always a valid fallback — if the browser cannot open (remote / headless / web host), the AI presents the same confirmations in chat.

## `confirm_ui/server.py`

```bash
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --daemon --wait   # launch + wait for Tier 1
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --wait-only       # Tier 2: attach to the running page, wait for the final result
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --daemon
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --daemon --port 5051
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --no-browser
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --timeout 0   # disable idle auto-shutdown
python3 scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --shutdown    # Step 4 cleanup (idempotent)
```

- Binds `127.0.0.1:5050` by default — or the next free port if another project already holds it (the launch log prints the actual URL) — and auto-opens the browser (suppress with `--no-browser`). `--port <other>` forces a specific port.
- **Shares port 5050 with the live preview server** (`svg_editor/server.py`). The two never run at once: confirm is Step 4, live preview is Step 6, and Step 4 always shuts this server down on exit (see `--shutdown`) so the port is free. One port = one forward rule for the whole pipeline. They still keep **separate processes and locks** (`.confirm_ui.lock` vs `.live_preview.lock`).
- `--daemon` starts the Flask process in the background; add `--wait` in the main pipeline so the parent command returns only after the page writes a fresh `result.json`. The `--wait` budget defaults to **590 s** (`--wait-timeout`), kept under the typical 600 s tool ceiling — run the launch with a long tool timeout (≈600000 ms). On timeout the parent returns non-zero but the detached server keeps running, so the caller must re-check `result.json` once before the chat fallback (a slow user may confirm just after the wait returns).
- `--wait-only` is the **second leg of the two-tier flow**: it does **not** launch a server — it attaches to the page already running from the first `--daemon --wait` and blocks until the page writes the **final** result (`stage: "final"`). It keys on the **stage alone** (no mtime gate): this run's tier-1 confirm already left result.json at `stage: "tier1"`, so any `final` is the tier-2 submit — and an mtime gate would race-miss a user who confirms tier 2 before this wait is issued. Same `--wait-timeout` budget; on timeout / server-gone it returns non-zero and the caller re-checks `result.json` once before the chat fallback.
- `--shutdown` stops a confirm server left running for this project and exits — **idempotent** (a no-op when nothing is running). Tries a graceful `/api/shutdown`, falls back to killing the recorded pid, then clears the lock. SKILL.md Step 4 runs this on every path (page-confirm or chat-fallback) so the page never lingers on the shared port before live preview starts.
- Refuses to start unless `<project_path>/confirm_ui/recommendations.json` exists (except `--shutdown`, which needs no recommendations).
- Per-project lock at `<project_path>/.confirm_ui.lock` — duplicate launches are refused; stale locks (dead pid) are overwritten.
- Idle auto-shutdown after 900 s by default; `/api/shutdown` exits gracefully and releases the lock.

Dependency:

```bash
pip install flask
```

## Two kinds of field

- **Enumerable + custom** — canvas / mode / visual_style / icons / image usage. The page lists common options from `static/catalogs.json`, badges the AI's recommendation, and still offers a Custom box for edge cases (custom canvas size, bespoke narrative mode, mixed image plan, self-provided icon system, etc.). `visual_style` additionally honors an optional `visual_style_spectrum` that badges a 3-pick personality spectrum (safe / shifted / bold, each with a temperament tag + analogy) in place of the single recommendation — see the schema below.
- **Closed enumerable** — formula policy / generation mode / refine spec, plus AI source only when image usage may include `ai`. These have no Custom box; out-of-catalog values snap back to the recommended option. Use pipeline vocabulary: icon ids are actual library ids such as `tabler-outline`, or `emoji` for system emoji; image usage labels mirror Strategist terminology: `ai` = AI-generated, `web` = Web-sourced, `provided` = User-provided, `placeholder` = Placeholder, `none` = No images. Use custom prose only when several sources are mixed.
- **Generative (open)** — color, typography, generated-image style. No finite catalog; the AI authors **≥3 candidates** the page renders as cards (never a single option — creative fields must offer real choice; fewer than 3 only on the honest-shortfall exception). `page_count`, `audience`, and `content_divergence` are free inputs (`content_divergence` is a free-text intent shown under audience in §c, not a fixed-option field).

**Custom box** appears only on fields whose universe is genuinely open — `canvas`, `mode`, `visual_style`, `icons`, and `image_usage`. Fully closed sets — `image_ai_path`, `formula_policy`, `generation_mode`, `refine_spec` — have **no** Custom box; an out-of-catalog value there is snapped back to the recommended option.

`image_ai_path` is conditional: the page shows it and writes it to `result.json` only when `image_usage` is `ai` or a custom image plan that may include AI. Web-sourced / User-provided / Placeholder / No images paths do not carry an AI backend choice.

## Catalogs — `static/catalogs.json` (the finite option universe)

The front-end loads `/api/catalogs` (served by the confirm server) and falls back to the static `/static/catalogs.json` if that route is unavailable. `/api/catalogs` returns the static file **with the `canvas` list synced live from `config.py CANVAS_FORMATS`** — the set of formats and their `dim` come from config (single source of truth, zero drift), while bilingual labels / use text stay in catalogs.json (a plain fallback label is synthesized for any new id config adds). Keys: `canvas`, `modes`, `visual_styles` (grouped), `icons`, `image_usage`, `image_ai_path`, `formula_policy`, `generation_mode`, `delivery_purpose`. Each entry is `{ "id", "label", "label_zh", "label_en", ... }`; descriptions use `desc_zh` / `desc_en`, and `visual_styles` groups use `group_zh` / `group_en`. The front-end falls back to legacy `label` / `desc` / `group`, so old catalogs still load, but new user-facing catalog text must be bilingual. English labels should mirror canonical reference names (`pyramid`, `swiss-minimal`, `Path A`, `mixed`, etc.); Chinese labels should be translated for users. Descriptions render inline after the option title, not as a separate selected-option line. `visual_styles` is `[{ "group", "group_zh", "group_en", "items": [...] }]`. For `canvas` you only need to maintain the bilingual labels in catalogs.json; the format set and dimensions are authoritative in `config.py CANVAS_FORMATS`.

## Round-trip data contract

Both files live under `<project_path>/confirm_ui/`.

### Two-tier flow

The page runs as a **two-tier wizard in one browser session**. `recommendations.json` carries a top-level `"tier"`:

| `tier` | Page renders | Button | On submit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | anchors — canvas, audience + `content_divergence` + `delivery_purpose` *(PPT only — omitted on non-PPT canvases, not written to the result)* (all in the §c key-info area), mode + visual_style | **Next** | writes `result.json` `{ stage: "tier1", status: "tier1-confirmed", <anchors> }`; the page does **not** close — it shows a "deriving…" state and polls `GET /api/recommendations` |
| `2` | realization — page count, color, typography, icons, formula, image usage + strategy, generation mode, refine spec | **Confirm** | writes `result.json` `{ stage: "final", status: "confirmed", <all fields> }`, then shuts the page down |
| *(absent)* | legacy single-pass — every section on one page | **Confirm** | single final write (`status: "confirmed"`) — backward-compatible |

The AI launches Tier 1 (`--daemon --wait`), reads the tier-1 result, **re-derives** the realization candidates from the user's actual anchors, overwrites `recommendations.json` with `"tier": 2` (realization fields only — it need not echo the anchors), and re-attaches with `--wait-only`. The page preserves the user's Tier 1 selections across the transition (single JS session). `GET /api/recommendations` is served `no-store` so the poll sees the tier-2 overwrite, and when `tier == 2` the server **folds the confirmed anchors from `result.json` back into the payload** (`recommend.canvas` / `mode` / `visual_style` / `delivery_purpose`, plus `audience` / `content_divergence` values) — so a **page refresh / reopen on Tier 2 re-initializes the anchors from the user's choices** instead of catalog defaults, even though those sections are not rendered on the Tier-2 page.

> Each `candidates` array above shows **one** entry for brevity — the creative fields (`color`, `typography`, `image_strategy`) must each carry **≥3** in a real file (see the rule above); `selected` indexes the recommended default.

- `recommend.*` names the recommended `id` for each enumerable field (must match a `catalogs.json` id, or be a free string for a recommended custom value). The page badges and pre-selects it. **Guarantee**: if a `recommend.*` is omitted, the page falls back to the first catalog option so every enumerable field always shows one badged recommendation — but the AI should still set them for a meaningful default. Legacy aliases are accepted for old files (`line` → `tabler-outline`, `filled` → `tabler-filled`, `monochrome` → `chunk-filled`, `search` → `web`, `default` → `auto`, `builtin` → `host-native`), but new files should write canonical ids. For `recommend.image_usage`, do not write bare `"custom"`; if several image sources are mixed, write the concrete prose plan directly, such as `"封面用 AI 生成，产品页用用户素材，行业页用网络来源"` / `"AI cover + user product assets + web industry images"`.
- When `recommend.image_usage` is `ai` or a custom plan that includes AI, also set `recommend.image_ai_path` to one of `auto` / `api` / `host-native` / `manual`; the page presents these as explicit choices.
- For a custom image plan, the page treats "may include AI" as true only when the recommendation includes `recommend.image_ai_path` or `image_strategy.candidates`; a custom plan without those signals is handled as non-AI and omits AI controls / fields.
- **Color candidates carry the user-facing core `palette`**: `background`, `secondary_bg`, `primary`, `accent`, `secondary_accent`, and `body_text`. The page renders labelled swatches and offers per-role override inputs for precise single-role edits, plus a **Custom color card with a free-text box** (parallel to the custom typography box) — the user can describe the palette in words or paste HEX values instead of filling each role; this writes `color: { "name": "custom", "custom": "<text>" }` to `result.json` for the AI to interpret. Legacy `text` is accepted as an alias for `body_text`, but new files should write `body_text`. Strategist derives secondary text, borders, state colors, and visual-style neutral tiers later when writing `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md`; those are not user-facing confirmation choices.
- **Candidate display text may be bilingual**: color / typography candidates can provide `name_zh` / `name_en` and `note_zh` / `note_en`; the page falls back to legacy `name` / `note`.
- **Typography candidates split CJK and Latin** for both `heading` and `body`; `css` is the fallback preview `font-family` stack. The page previews CJK sample text with `cjk + css` and Latin sample text with `latin + css`, so the two script choices are visible independently. Each candidate should also include `body_size` — the body baseline in **px** (the system's only unit, every canvas). The initial value comes from the candidate's `body_size`, sized for the recommended delivery purpose: `text` ~20 · `balanced` ~24 · `presentation` ~32. On submit the page writes `typography.body_size` as px directly — no pt conversion, no `body_size_pt` provenance. The page exposes `body_size` as an editable numeric field whose hint shows the recommended size — **one fixed px per delivery purpose on PPT (`text` 20 · `balanced` 24 · `presentation` 32), not a range** (non-PPT ≈2.5–3.3% of height in px). The user may still edit it; an out-of-range flag only warns if the value strays far (e.g. a unit mistake). **Inputs are independent — the hint updates with canvas / delivery purpose but never rewrites a value the user can see.** It also offers a custom typography text box so the user is not limited to the proposed candidates.
- **Per-role size override** (parallel to color's per-role HEX override): besides `body_size`, the page exposes **independent** editable inputs for `title` / `subtitle` / `annotation`. Each role is pre-filled **once** with a starting value — the candidate's `typography.sizes[role]` if provided, otherwise a one-time ramp suggestion (`body × ` mid-band ratio) — and then holds its own value. **There is no cross-field cascade**: changing `body_size`, `delivery_purpose`, or canvas updates only the recommended-value hint, never the role values; a re-render preserves exactly what the user sees. The final values are written to `result.json` as `typography.sizes: { "title", "subtitle", "annotation" }` in **px** — every canvas, no pt and no `sizes_pt` provenance. Seeding `sizes` in a candidate is optional — omit it and each role gets its one-time ramp suggestion.
- **`delivery_purpose`** (enumerable, PPT only) is the primary driver of the body baseline: `text` (read-close), `balanced` (business, the default), `presentation`. It is surfaced in the **§c key-information area** (beside audience, Tier 1) as a consumption-mode choice; the Tier-2 typography section then reads the confirmed value for the recommended body px — the pick itself does not rewrite the body field (inputs are independent). `recommend.delivery_purpose` pre-selects one (default `balanced`); the user's pick writes back to `result.json.delivery_purpose` as a plain id. Strategist uses it to set the px body baseline — **one fixed px per purpose (`text` 20 · `balanced` 24 · `presentation` 32), not a range** (see [strategist.md §g](../../references/strategist.md)). Non-PPT canvases omit it.
- **Combined style preview** — a compact live "overall impression" strip sits just above the color section and is **sticky**: it pins under the topbar so it stays visible while the user scrolls through the color / icon / typography sections, keeping the picking controls and their combined effect on screen together. It applies the currently selected color palette **and** typography (heading sample in `primary` over `background`, body sample in `body_text`, an `accent` bar, a `secondary_bg` chip) and repaints on every color / HEX-override / font / `body_size` change. It does not replace the per-candidate swatches or font samples (those stay for picking); it is deliberately an abstract style chip, **not** a slide-layout preview — page layout preview remains the live-preview server's job (Step 6). No schema field; it derives entirely from the existing color + typography selections.
- **Generated image style candidates** live in `image_strategy.candidates` and are shown only when `image_usage` is `ai` or a custom image plan may include generated images. Each candidate records `rendering`, `palette`, and short `visual` / `color` / `mood` lines from Strategist h.5. The chosen value is written to `result.json.image_strategy`; it is omitted when generated images are not part of the plan.
- **`visual_style_spectrum`** (optional) lets the AI surface the deck's aesthetic as a **personality spectrum** instead of one badged style. Each entry is `{ "id", "tag_zh"/"tag_en", "note_zh"/"note_en" }` where `id` is a real `visual_styles` catalog id; the page badges those chips with their temperament `tag` (replacing the single ★) and appends the `note` (a real-world analogy) inline. The full grouped style list and Custom box stay visible below, and `recommend.visual_style` is still the pre-selected default (it should equal the spectrum's safe pick). Author **≥3** spanning safe / shifted / bold (mirrors h.5; honest-shortfall exception applies — fewer only when the constraints genuinely cannot yield 3). The user's pick still writes back to `result.json.visual_style` as a plain id; the spectrum is presentation-only. Omit the field to fall back to the single-recommendation badge.
- `recommend.generation_mode` and `refine_spec` mirror the two mandatory notes in SKILL.md Step 4. Confirmed `generation_mode: "split"` / `refine_spec: true` are explicit user choices, equivalent to opting in through chat.
- `content_divergence` is a **free-text** field shown right under the audience box in §c — the user states in their own words how closely to follow the source vs how freely to reshape it (e.g. "stick closely to the document" / "freely restructure and expand within the source"). It is **not** a fixed-option field; blank means a balanced default. Whatever the level, facts stay sourced — reshaping develops what is in the source, never imports facts from outside it. The Strategist consumes the prose when authoring the §IX outline and records it in `design_spec.md §I`; it is **not** written to `spec_lock.md` (the Executor never reads it). It carries no page-count coupling and no source-signal recommendation — it is purely the user's stated intent. Beautify / template-fill keep content verbatim and do not surface this field.
- `lang` is a soft default; an explicit user language choice in the page (persisted to `localStorage`) wins.

### Output — `result.json` (written on submit, read by the AI)

```json
{
  "canvas": "ppt169",
  "page_count": "12-15",
  "audience": "...",
  "content_divergence": "freely restructure and expand within the source",
  "mode": "pyramid",
  "visual_style": "swiss-minimal",
  "color": { "name": "...", "palette": { "background": "#...", "secondary_bg": "#...", "primary": "#...", "accent": "#...", "secondary_accent": "#...", "body_text": "#..." } },
  "icons": "tabler-outline",
  "typography": { "name": "...", "heading": { "cjk": "...", "latin": "...", "css": "..." }, "body": { "cjk": "...", "latin": "...", "css": "..." }, "body_size": 24, "body_size_unit": "px", "sizes": { "title": 42, "subtitle": 32, "annotation": 18 } },
  "delivery_purpose": "balanced",
  "formula_policy": "mixed",
  "image_usage": "web",
  "image_strategy": { "name": "方案 A", "rendering": "vector-illustration", "palette": "cool-corporate", "visual": "...", "color": "...", "mood": "..." },
  "generation_mode": "continuous",
  "refine_spec": false,
  "stage": "final",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "confirmed_at": "2026-06-15T11:44:44"
}
```

The shape above is the **final** (Tier 2) result, carrying all Tier 1 + Tier 2 fields. The intermediate **Tier 1** write carries only the anchor fields plus `"stage": "tier1"`, `"status": "tier1-confirmed"`; the AI reads it to re-derive Tier 2 and never treats it as the final confirmation. A legacy single-pass write has no `stage` (or `stage: "final"`) and `status: "confirmed"`.

- Any option field may instead hold a **free-text custom string** (the user picked **Custom**); `color` / `typography` custom entries set `name: "custom"`. Image usage custom values must be concrete prose plans, not the literal string `"custom"`. The AI interprets custom text against the canonical references.
- `image_ai_path` and `image_strategy` are omitted from `result.json` unless `image_usage` is `ai` or a custom image plan that may include generated images. Both are honored downstream as confirmed choices — and the page is only a convenience surface over the **canonical chat channel**: the same choices made in chat are honored identically when no `result.json` exists. `image_ai_path` drives the Step 5 generation path (`image-generator.md` §7 — `host-native` forces the host tool even when `IMAGE_BACKEND` is set); the chosen `image_strategy` candidate is locked verbatim by Strategist h.5 (no re-pick).
- After the user clicks the **final Confirm** (Tier 2, or single-pass), the page saves `result.json` and shuts the server down (auto-close). A Tier-1 **Next** instead keeps the page open (it polls for the re-derived Tier 2). In the default flow, the first `--daemon --wait` returns on the tier-1 result and the second `--wait-only` returns on the final result; the AI reads each immediately — no extra chat confirmation is required. Chat confirmation remains the fallback when the page cannot be used. Either way, Step 4 ends with a `--shutdown` cleanup so a never-confirmed page cannot keep holding port 5050 ahead of the Step 6 live preview.

## Scope

- Confirmation surface only — Strategist authors every recommendation; the page never generates deck content.
- No SVG / layout preview here — that is the live preview server's job (`workflows/live-preview.md`, Step 6).
