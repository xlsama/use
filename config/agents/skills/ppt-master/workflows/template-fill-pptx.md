description: PPTX template fill workflow — use a native PowerPoint template deck, select fitting pages, and fill new material back without SVG conversion
---

# Template Fill (PPTX) Workflow

> Run when the user wants to fill new content into an existing deck. Typical requests include "fill this deck with the new content", "fill this back into the template", or "reuse this deck's design". They provide an existing `.pptx` as a native template deck plus topic / text materials and want the content filled back into that deck's design while selecting only the pages that fit the new story (a source page may be reused for several output slides).

This workflow is **independent** from the SVG generation pipeline. It treats the source PPTX as a native template / slide library, keeps the original PowerPoint design intact, and writes a new `.pptx` by cloning selected source slides and replacing text directly in OOXML.

## When to Run

Recognize any request that combines an existing PowerPoint with new content or a topic, for example:

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Existing `.pptx` + "fill back" intent | "Use this deck and fill in the attached material" |
| Existing `.pptx` + topic reuse | "Rework this PPTX around the new topic" |
| Existing `.pptx` + selective reuse | "Do not keep every page; only use the slides that fit" |
| Existing `.pptx` + copywriting replacement | "Keep the original design and replace the copy with this text" |
| Native PPT template fill | "Use this PowerPoint template for this content" |
| Direct wording | "Fill this deck with the new content" |

**Hard rule**: Do not run `pptx_to_svg.py`, `pptx_template_import.py`, `finalize_svg.py`, or `svg_to_pptx.py` for this workflow. SVG conversion is for presentation generation / template creation; this workflow is direct PowerPoint editing.

---

## Step 1: Inputs

🚧 **GATE**: The user has provided:

| Input | Required | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Source PPTX | Yes | Original design deck to reuse as a slide library |
| Content material | Yes | User text, Markdown, document, URL-derived source, or a clear topic brief |
| Target output intent | Optional | Audience, page count, tone, must-keep pages, must-drop pages |

If the content material is only a topic with no supporting facts, gather or ask for source material first. Do not invent detailed factual content.

---

## Step 2: Create the Project Workspace

Create a dedicated project directory under `projects/`. Do not write outputs directly into `projects/` root. Reuse the standard project manager so source import rules stay consistent with the rest of the repository:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/project_manager.py init "<project_name>" --format ppt169
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/project_manager.py import-sources "<project_dir>" "<source.pptx>" "<material...>"
```

**Source import rule**: `project_manager.py import-sources` copies files from outside the repository and moves repo-local files by default, unless `--copy` / `--move` is explicitly supplied. Keep this shared behavior; do not create a separate template-fill import path.

Use this fixed layout:

| Path | Required content |
|---|---|
| `<project_dir>/sources/` | Source PPTX and user-provided text / Markdown / converted materials |
| `<project_dir>/analysis/` | Slide library JSON, page-selection reasoning, and final fill plan |
| `<project_dir>/exports/` | Final generated PPTX only |
| `<project_dir>/validation/` | Read-back Markdown, extracted validation assets, and validation notes |

**Hard rule**: A template-fill project is a project, not a loose output file. The final answer must point to `<project_dir>/exports/<name>.pptx`, and all intermediate artifacts must remain inside `<project_dir>`.

---

## Step 3: Extract the PPTX Intake Bundle

`project_manager.py import-sources` automatically runs the standard PPTX intake for imported PowerPoint files and writes `<stem>.slide_library.json` into `<project_dir>/analysis/`. If you are working from a manually assembled project that does not have the intake artifact, run the template-fill analyzer directly:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/template_fill_pptx.py analyze "<project_dir>/sources/<source.pptx>" -o "<project_dir>/analysis/<stem>.slide_library.json"
```

Read `<project_dir>/analysis/<stem>.slide_library.json` (intake prefixes per-deck artifacts by the template deck's file stem) and identify:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `slides[].page_type` | Cover / chapter / content / ending candidate |
| `slides[].text_summary` | Current semantic purpose of the source page |
| `slides[].slots[]` | Replaceable text slots with `slot_id`, `role`, `geometry`, paragraph count, and old text |
| `slides[].slots[].role` | Title / body / label candidate hint |
| `slides[].tables[]` | Native PowerPoint tables with `table_id`, row / column counts, and per-cell coordinates + text |
| `slides[].charts[]` | Native PowerPoint charts with `chart_id` |

**Selection rule**: Pick pages by content fitness, not by source order alone. A source page is useful only if its visible structure can carry the target message without heavy redesign.

A page's layout already encodes a rhetorical shape — a single hero statement, a lead-then-detail split, a 2×2 comparison, a stepwise progression, a metric row. Match the source material's own logic to a page whose structure expresses that same logic; do not pour unrelated content into a slot just because it is empty. When no selected page fits a piece of content well, drop that page or that content rather than forcing it — a forced fill reads as stiff. It is fine to use fewer pages than the source deck has.

**Layout-first planning**: Treat `<stem>.slide_library.json` as a layout inventory, not as an ordered deck outline. Before writing `fill_plan.json`, infer each reusable source page's affordance from JSON fields:

| JSON signal | Layout planning use |
|---|---|
| `slides[].page_type` | Identify cover / TOC / chapter / ending candidates, but do not preserve their original order by default |
| `slots[].role` counts | Infer whether the page is a hero statement, comparison, multi-card list, timeline, metric row, or dense explanation |
| `slots[].geometry` | Estimate whether each text slot is a short label, medium title, body block, caption, or decorative number |
| `slots[].text_metrics.font_size_px` | Estimate text capacity together with geometry; larger type means fewer safe characters |
| `slots[].text_summary` | Read the source page's original rhetorical pattern, not its literal placeholder wording |

**Hard rule**: The target story controls output order. Source slides may move forward, move backward, be omitted, or be reused several times when their layout matches multiple target messages. Never treat source slide order as a default outline unless the user explicitly asks to preserve it.

**Required mapping pass**: Record a concise page-to-layout rationale in each planned slide before finalizing the plan. Use the per-slide `layout_rationale` object in `fill_plan.json` with `layout_pattern`, `why_fit`, and `risk`. This is human-review evidence that selection came from template structure rather than sequential replacement; it is not a mechanical checker gate.

---

## Step 4: Build the Fill Plan

Create a scaffold:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/template_fill_pptx.py scaffold "<project_dir>/analysis/<stem>.slide_library.json" -o "<project_dir>/analysis/fill_plan.json" --slides "1,3,4"
```

Then edit `<project_dir>/analysis/fill_plan.json` by hand from the source material. The plan is the single execution contract.

**Pages are reusable**: the output is the ordered `slides` list, not a one-to-one copy of the source deck. A source page is not single-use — list the same `source_slide` as many times as you need, each entry with its own `replacements`, to drive several output slides from one good layout (e.g., reuse a single content layout for five content pages). Likewise you may omit source pages entirely and put the selected ones in any order.

**Scaffold boundary**: `scaffold --slides` is only a convenience starter. If the final plan needs repeated source pages or a story order that differs from the template order, duplicate / reorder entries in `fill_plan.json` manually or generate the plan from `<stem>.slide_library.json`; do not let scaffold output constrain the deck structure.

The plan structure:

```json
{
  "schema": "template_fill_pptx_plan.v1",
  "status": "draft",
  "source_pptx": "projects/source.pptx",
  "accepted_warnings": [
    {
      "plan_slide": 3,
      "slot_id": "s03_sh5",
      "code": "text_capacity",
      "reason": "User accepted dense wording"
    }
  ],
  "slides": [
    {
      "source_slide": 1,
      "purpose": "cover",
      "layout_rationale": {
        "layout_pattern": "hero cover",
        "why_fit": "Large title and subtitle slots fit the opening message without redesign.",
        "risk": "Subtitle must stay short."
      },
      "notes": "Speaker notes for this filled slide.",
      "transition": "fade",
      "replacements": [
        {
          "slot_id": "s01_sh4",
          "text": "New title"
        }
      ],
      "table_edits": [
        {
          "table_id": "s01_tbl3",
          "cells": [
            {"row": 0, "col": 0, "text": "Metric"},
            {"row": 0, "col": 1, "text": "Value"}
          ]
        }
      ],
      "chart_edits": [
        {
          "chart_id": "s01_ch4",
          "categories": ["A", "B"],
          "series": [
            {"name": "Series 1", "values": [10, 20]}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Per-slide plan discipline**:

| Decision | Rule |
|---|---|
| `status` | Keep `"draft"` until the user has reviewed the page sequence / reuse / deletion decisions. Set to `"confirmed"` only after approval. |
| `source_slide` | Repeat the same value across multiple entries to reuse one source layout for several output slides; order is free and must follow the target story rather than source deck order |
| `layout_rationale` | Human review aid for page selection. Include `layout_pattern`, `why_fit`, and `risk`; it is not a mechanical checker gate. |
| `accepted_warnings` | Optional audit trail for warnings the user or agent explicitly accepts. `check-plan` warnings remain non-blocking; errors must be fixed. |
| `notes` | Optional spoken speaker notes for the filled slide — see **Speaker notes** below; write prose, not a copy of the on-slide text |
| `transition` | Optional per-slide page transition; overrides the `apply --transition` default. Accepts an effect name (`fade` / `push` / `wipe` / `split` / `strips` / `cover` / `random`), `none` to strip it, or `{ "effect": "push", "duration": 0.6 }` |
| `replacements` | Target by `slot_id` whenever possible; `shape_id` and `shape_name` are fallback selectors |
| `table_edits` | Optional native table cell edits; target by `table_id` whenever possible and use zero-based `row` / `col` |
| `chart_edits` | Optional native chart data edits; target by `chart_id`, set `categories`, and provide one or more `series` |
| Short text | For labels / chapter names / directory items, fit the slot's visual capacity from geometry and font size; do not rely on old placeholder length alone |
| Body text | May be moderately freer than the original, but keep paragraph count, visual width, and information density near the slot's geometry capacity |
| Empty slots | Use `scaffold --include-empty` only when a real placeholder is empty in the source deck |
| Native tables | Keep the original table row and column count; this workflow edits existing cells, not table structure |
| Native charts | Each series `values` list must match the category count; this workflow edits chart data, not chart styling |
| Multi-plot / combo charts | Not supported for direct `chart_edits`; `check-plan` reports an error rather than silently writing the wrong plot. Use beautify / main pipeline to redraw them, or leave the native chart untouched. |
| Facts | Every substantive claim must come from the user material |

**Fit check before apply**:

- Cover pages: replace title / subtitle / author only.
- Chapter pages: use short section labels.
- Dense content pages: compress material to bullets matching the existing slot capacity.
- Decorative or image-heavy pages: avoid forcing long prose into label-sized slots.
- Repeated source pages: every repeated entry must carry a distinct purpose and replacement set; avoid visual repetition unless the repeated layout expresses the same rhetorical pattern.
- Reordered source pages: verify the new sequence reads as a coherent story; template page numbers, decorative section markers, and notes must be updated to match the output order.

**Speaker notes (the `notes` field)** — distilled from the main pipeline's Logic Construction Phase, scaled to one note per planned slide:

Each `notes` value is **pure spoken narration**: write only what a presenter would say aloud, so the same text also works if the deck is later sent through `notes_to_audio.py`. The note explains and connects; it must not just restate the words already on the slide.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Length | 2–5 natural sentences carrying the page's core message; cover / chapter / ending pages can be one or two sentences |
| Transitions | Carry page-to-page flow in the opening sentence as natural prose ("在明确了背景之后……" / "Having framed X, let's turn to Y") — never bracketed `[过渡]` / `[Transition]` tags |
| Plain prose only | No `#` heading line, no `- ` bullet lists, no `要点：① …` / `Key points:` lines, no `时长：2分钟` / `Duration:` annotations — embedded notes keep them verbatim and TTS would read them aloud |
| Number readability | Spell out figures when literal TTS pronunciation is awkward (Chinese "百分之六十八" over "68%"; plain English integers and percentages are fine) |
| One language | Match the deck's language; do not mix languages inside one note |
| Source-bound | Every substantive claim comes from the user material, same as `replacements` |

Example `notes` value for a Chinese content slide:

```json
"notes": "在看清整体市场格局之后，我们把镜头拉近到成都二手房的头部板块。当前挂牌均价同比上涨约百分之十二，但成交周期反而拉长到九十天以上，说明买方观望情绪在加重。这组数据是后面定价策略的基础，请重点留意。"
```

## Step 5: Check Text Capacity

Run the data-based capacity check before applying the plan:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/template_fill_pptx.py check-plan "<project_dir>/analysis/<stem>.slide_library.json" "<project_dir>/analysis/fill_plan.json" -o "<project_dir>/analysis/check_report.json"
```

Interpret the report:

| Warning type | Action |
|---|---|
| Short label exceeds visual width | Rewrite shorter or choose a layout with a larger label slot; do not shrink font by default |
| Title too long | Rewrite first; only use font-size changes as a last resort |
| Body much longer than source slot | Compress, split across another selected page, or choose a larger source page |
| Missing target | Fix `slot_id` / `shape_id`; do not apply the plan |

`check-plan` emits stable `code` fields in its JSON results so warnings can be tracked without parsing message text. Warnings are advisory and do not fail the command; record any intentionally accepted warning in `accepted_warnings` when it matters for review. Errors are blocking and must be fixed before apply.

**Default fitting policy**: Check fit against visual capacity, not raw character count. CJK characters, Latin letters, numbers, and punctuation occupy different visual widths; old placeholder text is only a weak signal. Use `capacity_visual_width` when present, together with `slots[].geometry` and `slots[].text_metrics.font_size_px`, to decide whether to rewrite, split, or choose a different source layout. Do not use per-item font shrinking as a default strategy because it breaks template consistency.

---

## Step 6: Apply the Plan

⛔ **BLOCKING GATE**: The user has reviewed the planned output order, omitted pages, reused pages, and material-to-layout fit. Set `<project_dir>/analysis/fill_plan.json` top-level `status` to `"confirmed"` only after that review. `apply` rejects an unconfirmed plan by default; `--force` exists only for deliberate recovery/debug use.

Run:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/template_fill_pptx.py apply "<project_dir>/sources/<source.pptx>" "<project_dir>/analysis/fill_plan.json" -o "<project_dir>/exports/<output.pptx>"
```

By default `apply` gives every cloned slide a `fade` transition (`0.5s`), because most native templates ship an empty `<p:transition/>` that renders as *no* motion. Override the default with `--transition <effect>` (`fade` / `push` / `wipe` / `split` / `strips` / `cover` / `random`) and `--transition-duration <seconds>`; pass `--transition none` for no motion, or `--transition keep` to preserve each source slide's existing transition unchanged. A per-slide `transition` field in the plan overrides whatever the CLI selects for that slide.

`apply` appends a timestamp automatically. For example, `-o "<project_dir>/exports/demo.pptx"` writes `demo_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pptx`. If the filename already ends with `_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`, it is left unchanged.

The script:

| Behavior | Result |
|---|---|
| Clones selected source slides | Original slide design, relationships, images, layouts, and animations are preserved where PowerPoint supports them |
| Replaces text nodes | Text frames remain editable in PowerPoint |
| Writes `notes` fields | Speaker notes are embedded as native PowerPoint notes slides |
| Applies `--transition` / per-slide `transition` | Populates each slide's `<p:transition>` with a native PowerPoint page transition |
| Rebuilds presentation slide list | Output deck contains only the planned slide sequence |
| Adds timestamp to PPTX filename | Matches the main SVG-to-PPTX export convention |
| Drops orphaned source parts | Output carries only the selected pages and the layouts / media / charts they still reference (reachability prune) |

**Animation policy**: Template-fill preserves each cloned slide's existing object animation XML (the SVG pipeline's generated object animation defaults are not applied here). Page transitions are the one motion layer this workflow writes directly, and `apply` adds a `fade` transition by default so a filled deck is never left with the template's empty no-motion transitions; change it with `apply --transition` / a per-slide `transition` field, or opt out with `--transition keep` (preserve source) or `--transition none`. If the user asks to change object-level animation order / timing / effects, treat that as a separate direct-PPTX animation customization task.

---

## Step 7: Validate Output

Run a lightweight readability check:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/template_fill_pptx.py validate "<project_dir>"
```

The validator finds the latest PPTX in `<project_dir>/exports/`, runs `ppt_to_md.py` into `<project_dir>/validation/readback.md`, and writes `<project_dir>/validation/validate_report.json`. `exports/` must contain only final deliverables.

Verify:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| Output filename | Ends with `_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pptx` |
| Slide count | Matches `len(fill_plan.slides)` |
| Key title text | Appears in the extracted Markdown |
| Native table cells | Updated values appear in the extracted Markdown table |
| Native chart data | Updated labels / values are readable from the extracted Markdown when `ppt_to_md.py` can surface them |
| Multi-line body text | Preserves intended line / paragraph breaks |
| Speaker notes | Read-back note count matches planned `notes` fields |
| Missing target errors | None from `template_fill_pptx.py apply` |

If the extracted text is correct but visual overflow is likely, reduce the text in `fill_plan.json` and re-run Step 4.

```markdown
