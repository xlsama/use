"""Storyboard schema — provider-agnostic.

Each shot will be turned into one DashScope video-synthesis request by
``videogen render``. The shot itself only declares a generic *kind*
(``t2v`` | ``i2v`` | ``r2v``). Mapping to a concrete model name is the
provider's job — see ``scripts/providers/``.

Per-kind duration ceilings (worst case across providers; the active
provider may impose a tighter cap of its own):

    t2v  → 2..15s
    i2v  → 2..15s
    r2v  → 2..15s

We default each shot to 15s — the max for our active models — to minimize
cuts and maximize cross-shot continuity. Override per shot if you genuinely
need a quick beat. Each provider also enforces its own duration *floor*
(Wan: 2s, HappyHorse: 3s).

Backward-compat: if ``Shot`` JSON still carries the old ``model`` field
with a ``wan2.7-*`` or ``happyhorse-1.0-*`` literal, we transparently
translate it to the new ``kind`` field on validate.
