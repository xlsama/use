"""BGM (background music) module — discovery + filename resolution.

Two-tier model (same shape as cast / movie-set):

    projects/<id>/bgm/                ← project-shared library (sitcom-wide)
    projects/<id>/<episode>/bgm/      ← episode-only tracks

A BGM file is just an audio file (.mp3 / .wav / .m4a / .flac / .ogg / .aac)
dropped into one of those folders. Filename (without extension) is the
**track id** referenced from ``storyboard.bgm.tracks[].file`` and from
``Scene.bgm_track``.

This module is intentionally narrow:

* No upload — BGM stays local, mixed onto the final video by ffmpeg at
  stitch time. We don't send it to DashScope.
* No transcoding — ffmpeg ``mix_bgm`` handles re-encoding when it mixes.

Public API:

* ``discover(project_id, episode_id)`` → list of available tracks with
  ``source: project | episode``. Episode wins when filenames collide.
* ``resolve_track(project_id, episode_id, name)`` → absolute ``Path`` to
  the audio file, or ``None`` if not found.
* ``project_bgm_dir`` / ``episode_bgm_dir`` — directory accessors.
