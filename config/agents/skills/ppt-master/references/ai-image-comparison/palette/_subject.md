# Palette Comparison Set

## Controlled variables

| Dimension | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Palette | **varies (14 palettes)** | under comparison |
| Rendering | `vector-illustration` | fixed baseline |
| Composition | single-subject hero — see [`image-generator.md`](../../image-generator.md) §4.1 Primitive A | fixed baseline |

## Subject

> A confident professional standing beside an upward growth chart, looking forward — single dominant subject occupying 60-70% of the canvas. This is the "single-subject hero" composition described as [`image-generator.md`](../../image-generator.md) §4.1 Primitive A, used here as a stable baseline because a single dominant subject makes palette color behavior read most clearly.

## On HEX values

**Important**: this set does **not** fix HEX values across all 14 palettes. Each palette uses its own typical HEX triplet.

Reason: a palette is a *color behavior* (saturation, contrast, temperament, proportion), and the HEX it expects is part of that behavior. Forcing cool-corporate's deep navy through a vivid-launch palette would produce a strange "restrained navy mimicking promotional energy" image — losing the semantic representativeness of the palette.

This also matches real production: a user who picks vivid-launch will have vivid HEX values in their `design_spec`, not navy. This set simulates each palette's typical production scenario.

Each filename is `<palette>.png`, matching the corresponding file under `references/image-palettes/`.

## How to read this set

Scan all 14 images side by side. Focus on:

- **Color temperature** — cool-professional vs warm-human vs neutral-editorial
- **Saturation** — restrained vs vivid vs monochrome
- **The 60-30-10 proportional feel** — how dominant the secondary really is
- **Accent weight** — how much visual presence the small accent commands
