# Template Designer — Template Design Role

## Core Mission

Generate reusable page templates inside the complete workspace selected by `create-template`, and write a concise `design_spec.md` that captures the source-derived basic norms that make the template reusable.

> This is a standalone role: only triggered via the `/create-template` workflow. Library and project outputs use one workspace shape; it is not the template selection step in the main PPT generation pipeline.

## Usage

- **Trigger**: `/create-template` workflow
- **Workspace root**: `library` (default) → `skills/ppt-master/templates/<kind_dir>/<template_name>/`; `project` → the confirmed `<target_project>/`
- **Template source**: `<template_workspace>/templates/` in both scopes
- **Input**: finalized template brief (output scope, target project when project-scoped, template ID, display name, kind, applicable scenarios, tone, theme mode, canvas format, optional reference assets, accepted basic template norms)

**Hard rule — scope is execution metadata**: Use `output_scope` and `target_project` to route files, but do not write either field into portable `design_spec.md` frontmatter. Do not create a new PPTX structure mode; deck/layout output declares `native_structure_mode: structured`.

**Workspace precondition**: The workflow has already resolved the selected root, confirmed an empty `<template_workspace>/templates/`, and checked collision-free destination filenames in `images/`, `icons/`, and `templates/icons/`. Check `exports/` only when an on-demand review PPTX was requested. Optional directories may be absent until their first real file is written. Project scope additionally requires an initialized target project. Do not begin final writes before that all-at-once preflight passes.

When the workflow provides a PPTX reference source, the effective input package comes from the unified `pptx_template_import.py` preparation workspace and becomes:

- finalized template brief
- `manifest.json` — single source of truth for source-deck facts (slide size, theme, per-master themes, assets, asset map, placeholders, layouts, masters, slides, SVG file paths, page-type candidates)
- `native_structure.json` — stable source master/layout keys, picker names, parent-master relationships, placeholder type/index/geometry, source hash, and source-graph quality facts
- `source_template.pptx` — byte-preserved analysis copy for visual/package cross-checking; never a final template asset
- `summary.md` — short orientation digest derived from manifest.json
- exported `assets/`
- `svg/master_*.svg` / `svg/layout_*.svg` — lossless layered import evidence; every master / layout in the deck rendered once, including ones no sample slide references
- `svg/slide_NN.svg` — lossless slide-local import evidence; do not bulk-read because opaque native payload is retained
- `svg/inheritance.json` — which layout / master each slide consumes
- `svg-flat/slide_NN.svg` — lossless complete-page import evidence; use it as mirror restoration authority, not as model-facing context
- `authoring-svg/` / `authoring-svg-flat/` — lightweight non-destructive projections created by `svg_authoring_view.py`; these are the model-facing layered and complete-page views
- optional screenshots for visual cross-checking

PPTX import interpretation:

- Placeholder guides in master / layout SVGs are layout signals. Use `manifest.json` placeholder records for type / index / geometry / base style; do not copy dashed guide boxes into final templates unless the visual design truly uses dashed boxes.
- Charts, SmartArt, diagrams, and OLE objects may appear as typed placeholders in layered SVGs. In flat SVGs they may show preview images. Treat them as source intent markers, not reusable decorative assets.
- The asset filenames referenced by SVGs are governed by the manifest asset map. Prefer those references over inventing duplicate asset names.

Input priority for PPTX-backed template creation depends on replication mode:

| Mode | Authoritative inputs | Model-facing inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `standard` / `fidelity` | Finalized brief for the newly designed output; `manifest.json` for factual canvas/theme/assets | Lightweight `authoring-svg-flat/` pages and exported assets as visual references. Source Master/Layout topology is informational only and is not mined into output structure. |
| `mirror` | `manifest.json`, `native_structure.json`, lossless layered `svg/`, lossless complete-page `svg-flat/`, and `svg/inheritance.json` | Matching lightweight `authoring-svg/` and `authoring-svg-flat/` projections for inspection. The projections never replace the lossless restoration source. |

Use `summary.md` only for orientation. Open screenshots or the original PPTX only for visual cross-checking.

**Native structure output**: Always set `native_structure_mode: structured`.

| Mode | Output structure contract |
|---|---|
| `standard` / `fidelity` | Author new SVG prototypes and an intentional new Master/Layout/slot system. Source visual language and assets may guide the design, but source ownership, keys, picker names, parent relationships, placeholders, and repeated Slide-local elements do not define or seed the output topology. Use compact canonical metadata for authored objects. |
| `mirror` | Restore the source graph one-to-one: keep source Master/Layout identities and parentage, slide assignments, placeholder type/index/bounds, and supported visual/native-object facts. Mechanical normalization maps fixed-layer source groups into the direct atoms required by the current explicit SVG contract while preserving ownership, paint order, and appearance; it must not semantically redesign the graph. |

Every page remains a complete standalone SVG preview.

**Hard rule — mirror graph reachability**: The current structured template
compiler materializes only Master/Layout identities referenced by emitted SVG
prototypes. Before accepting `mirror`, verify that every source Layout has a
non-empty `usedBySlides` set and that every source Master owns at least one such
Layout. If the source package contains an unused Layout or an otherwise
unreachable Master, stop and report that full-graph mirror is not representable
by the current template roster. Never silently drop it, merge it, or invent a
carrier page.

**Hard rule — no duplicate authored Layout contracts**: In `standard` / `fidelity`, distinct output Layout keys must differ in fixed Layout atoms or slot topology/type/index/bounds/binding. Topic, sample wording, or Slide-local content alone never justifies another authored key. Mirror keeps source Layout identities even when two source contracts are visibly equivalent.

**Downstream boundary**: The Strategist confirmation stage selects `strict` or `adaptive` when a project consumes this package. Both export through `pptx_structure.mode: structured`. Strict keeps the referenced Layout contract; adaptive may create a new Layout identity while retaining the template Master. Template_Designer does not preselect that project-level choice.

For `mirror`, `design_spec.md §V` must be followed by a `Source Restoration Map` that records each source slide's Master/Layout assignment and output file. The map is evidence of one-to-one preservation, not a design-decision log. `standard` and `fidelity` record only their newly authored output roster and structure; do not add a source-topology disposition table.

---

## Page Roster

The output page set is determined by **replication mode**, declared in the finalized template brief:

| Mode | When to use | Roster |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `standard` (default) | Most templates — clean, reusable, balanced coverage | `01_cover`, `02_chapter`, `03_content`, `04_ending`, optional `02_toc` |
| `fidelity` | User wants a broader, source-aligned but newly designed template | Standard roster + intentionally designed variants that cover useful reference compositions |
| `mirror` | User wants the source template restored | One SVG prototype restored from the lossless source per source slide, named `<NNN>_<page_type>.svg` by source order |

**Hard rule — mode controls authorship**: `standard` and `fidelity` create new SVG documents and their own Master/Layout system. `mirror` restores the imported source contract and must not reauthor, distill, or reinterpret its structure.

### Standard mode

| # | Filename | Purpose | Description |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|
| 01 | `01_cover.svg` | Cover | Fixed structure: title, subtitle, date, organization |
| 02 | `02_chapter.svg` | Chapter page | Fixed structure: chapter number, chapter title |
| 03 | `03_content.svg` | Content page | Flexible structure: only defines header/footer; content area freely laid out by AI |
| 04 | `04_ending.svg` | Ending page | Fixed structure: thank-you message, contact info |
| -- | `02_toc.svg` | Table of contents | Optional: TOC title, chapter list (number + title) |

**Design philosophy**: Templates define visual consistency and structural pages; content pages maintain maximum flexibility.

**Naming note**: TOC page keeps `02_toc.svg` naming for template library compatibility and sort order.

### Fidelity mode

When the brief sets `Replication mode: fidelity`, design a broader reusable roster that stays close to the source's visual language and useful composition examples. The output Master/Layout system is authored independently from source topology.

**Variant naming**: append a lowercase letter suffix to the parent type's index, preserving sort order:

| Parent type | Example variants |
|-------------|------------------|
| Chapter | `02a_chapter_full.svg`, `02b_chapter_minimal.svg` |
| Content | `03a_content_two_col.svg`, `03b_content_data_card.svg`, `03c_content_quote.svg` |
| Ending | `04a_ending_thanks.svg`, `04b_ending_contact.svg` |

Extension page types beyond the canonical four (transition / appendix / disclaimer / divider) take the next free index: `05_section_break.svg`, `06_appendix.svg`, `07_disclaimer.svg`.

**Roster decision**:

- Choose variants from useful visual composition types such as two-column content, hero image, icon grid, data card, and quote
- Keep only variants that add a genuinely useful authored composition; source Layout keys and repeated source chrome are not clustering inputs
- Design each variant's Master/Layout/slot contract directly from its intended reusable behavior
- Record every emitted page in `design_spec.md §V Page Roster`; in library scope, `register_template.py` generates the corresponding index entry from `<template_workspace>/templates/*.svg`. Project scope skips registration

> Variants reuse the parent type's placeholder set — see §4 (Placeholder Reference) below.

### Mirror mode

When the brief sets `Replication mode: mirror`, restore the imported template rather than designing a new one:

- Restoration source: lossless `svg/master_*.svg`, `svg/layout_*.svg`, `svg/slide_NN.svg`, `svg-flat/slide_NN.svg`, `svg/inheritance.json`, and `native_structure.json`. Use matching lightweight projections only to inspect the result without loading opaque payload into model context.
- Precondition: every source Layout is referenced by at least one source slide, and every source Master is reachable through those referenced Layouts. Otherwise report that full-graph mirror is currently unsupported and stop before writing output.
- Output: `<template_workspace>/templates/<NNN>_<page_type>.svg` in both scopes. `<NNN>` is the zero-padded source slide index (3 digits) and `<page_type>` is derived from `manifest.json` `pageTypeCandidates` — `cover` / `toc` / `chapter` / `content` / `ending`. When the page-type heuristic is ambiguous, fall back to `content`. Preserve source slide order via the numeric prefix.
- Required restoration: preserve source Master/Layout keys and picker names, Layout-to-Master parentage, slide assignments, placeholder type/index/bounds, supported native-object metadata, geometry, decoration, sprite-sheet wrappers, original example text, chart previews, fonts, effects, and paint order whenever the importer represents them.
- Allowed normalization: add or normalize explicit root declarations and asset paths, and recursively expand fixed Master/Layout group wrappers into direct atoms. The mapping must remain one-to-one at the ownership level and must not change paint order or appearance.
- Forbidden: commonality extraction, semantic synthesis, merging, splitting, promotion, demotion, renaming, re-parenting, decorative simplification, placeholder invention, or replacement of supported source-native metadata / SVG fallback with a model-authored approximation.
- `design_spec.md` §V Page Roster lists every emitted file, and `Source Restoration Map` records the preserved source Master/Layout assignment.

**Mirror consumption boundary**: `mirror` applies only while creating the template package from the source deck. Once created, the package is consumed as an ordinary deck / layout template roster: downstream generation may select, repeat, skip, reorder, or adapt pages according to the new content. The `replication_mode: mirror` field must not force the generated deck to preserve the source page count, source order, or one-output-slide-per-template-slide mapping.

**What mirror is not**: a redesign or topology-cleanup mode. It may mechanically transcode the imported representation into the current explicit SVG/package contract, so byte identity is not promised. Charts, SmartArt, OLE objects, and EMF / WMF media that fail to round-trip in `pptx_template_import.py` will fail the same way in mirror. If the import workspace has missing media or unsupported objects, mirror inherits those gaps — report them before restoration begins.

## Template Design Specifications

### 1. Must Generate design_spec.md

**Scope rule — personality only.** A template `design_spec.md` describes **what makes this template recognizable**: brand colors, signature decorative motifs, page-by-page visual character, bundled assets. It does **not** restate generic constraints — those live in the canonical references and are already loaded by every downstream role:

- General SVG required / forbidden / conditional interfaces → [`shared-standards.md`](shared-standards.md)
- Generic layout pattern library, spacing bands, font-size ratio bands → [`templates/design_spec_reference.md`](../templates/design_spec_reference.md) (read by Strategist when authoring the **project** design_spec)
- Canonical placeholder vocabulary → §4 below
- Content methodology (pyramid / SCQA / MECE) → [`strategist.md`](strategist.md)

Re-declaring any of these in a template `design_spec.md` is noise — Strategist already has them in context, and duplication forces every relaxation to sweep N templates instead of one source. **If a rule is generic, omit it. If this template breaks a generic rule, write only the deviation.**

**Required skeleton:**

The frontmatter is portable across library and project scope. Do not add
`output_scope` or `target_project`; those belong only to the workflow execution
brief.

# [Template Name] — Design Specification

## I. Template Overview
- Use cases, design tone, theme mode (light / dark / mixed)
- One paragraph: what visually identifies this template at a glance

## II. Color Scheme
- HEX values with role labels (primary / accent / background / text / etc.)
- Brand-specific application rules when present (e.g. "KPI cards rotate blue→green→red→yellow")

## III. Typography (omit when using the default `Arial, "Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` stack)
- Per-role font stacks ONLY when the template intentionally diverges (display serif title, brand typeface, etc.)
- Font-install or embedding requirement when a non-preinstalled font leads any stack
- Body baseline px (informational; `spec_lock.md` owns the actual values per project)

## IV. Signature Design Elements
- Decorative motifs that ARE this template — top bar, gradient underline, logo treatment, brand emblem placement
- Source-derived layout grammar — grid / column rhythm, page chrome, image zones, mask / crop behavior, overlay treatment, and density rhythm that make the template recognizable
- Optional XML snippet for any reusable component unique to this template

## V. Page Roster
One row per emitted SVG describing what this template's version of cover / chapter / content / ending looks like (background treatment, decorative anchors, layout rhythm, image behavior, content density, intended content slot). For `standard` / `fidelity`, record the newly authored Layout key and PowerPoint picker name. For `mirror`, record the restored source Master/Layout keys and picker names without redesigning them. Roster entries must match the actual SVG files on disk.

For `mirror`, add `### Source Restoration Map` immediately after the roster with columns `Source slide`, `Source Master`, `Source Layout`, `Output SVG`, and `Restoration status`. This is a one-to-one mapping record. Do not add synthesis rationale or source-structure disposition rows to `standard` / `fidelity` templates.

## VI. Assets (omit when none)
Logos, cover backgrounds, brand textures bundled with the template package — file name, dimensions, intended usage.

## VII. Placeholder Overrides (omit when none)
Reference the `placeholders:` frontmatter declaration and explain the rationale (e.g. "consulting decks lead with `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` instead of `{{PAGE_TITLE}}`").
```

Sections to **omit** from template `design_spec.md` (sourced elsewhere — listing them here is noise):

| Don't write | Source |
|---|---|
| General SVG technical / compatibility rules | `shared-standards.md` |
| Generic layout pattern library (centered card / three-column / timeline / …) | `design_spec_reference.md` §V |
| Generic spacing bands (margin 40-60px, card gap 20-32px, etc.) | `design_spec_reference.md` §V |
| Generic font-size hierarchy (cover 2.5-5x body, page title 1.5-2x, …) | `design_spec_reference.md` §IV |
| Canonical placeholder table (`{{TITLE}}`, `{{PAGE_NUM}}`, …) | §4 below |
| Content methodology (pyramid / SCQA / MECE) | `strategist.md` |
| "Usage Instructions" boilerplate (copy template / select page / …) | `create-template.md` |
| Created Date / Page Count rows | not a library-level field |

When rewriting an existing template that contains an omitted generic section,
delete it rather than leaving a pointer. Keep a template-specific boundary only
inside the personality section it qualifies (asset system, motif, image
treatment, or page roster); do not preserve a generic technical-rules heading.

### 2. Inherit Design Specification

Templates must strictly follow the finalized template brief and the generated `design_spec.md`:
- **Canvas dimensions**: `canvas_format` is not enough; root SVG `viewBox` matches `canvas_viewbox` in the design spec. Root `width` / `height` are optional compatibility attributes and are not PPT Master canvas authority.
- **Source canvas**: when a PPTX/SVG reference is used, record `source_canvas_width`, `source_canvas_height`, and `source_viewbox`. If the output canvas differs from the source, normalize all geometry, typography, line heights, strokes, and image crop coordinates explicitly instead of relying on the shared aspect ratio.
- **Color scheme**: Uses primary, secondary, and accent colors from the spec
- **Font plan**: Uses the per-role font families declared in the spec
- **Layout principles**: Margins and spacing conform to the spec
- **Image system**: Image placement, crop / mask behavior, full-bleed zones, and overlay rules follow the source-derived norms in the spec

If PPTX import output exists:
- Prefer imported theme colors and fonts over visually guessed values
- Reuse exported `assets/` images directly — `<image>` references in `svg/` already point at canonical files
- Treat page-type candidates from `manifest.pageTypeCandidates` as hints, not guarantees

**Precondition**:

- For `standard`, inspect enough lightweight complete-page projections to understand the requested visual direction and reusable assets; do not analyze source topology.
- For `fidelity`, inspect every lightweight complete-page projection so the newly designed roster covers the useful source composition range; do not derive output ownership from source Master/Layout recurrence.
- For `mirror`, verify every projected Master, Layout, and Slide against `native_structure.json` and `svg/inheritance.json`, then restore from the matching lossless files. Before restoration begins, report the verified source slide indexes.

### 2.1 PPTX Import Mode Rule

The imported PPTX has a different authority level in each replication mode.

| Mode | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| `standard` | Use source visuals/assets as references, then author the compact canonical roster and its Master/Layout/slot structure from the confirmed brief. Do not preserve or distill source topology. |
| `fidelity` | Use the complete visual roster as design reference, then author a broader canonical roster and its own Master/Layout/slot structure. Match the source visual language closely, but do not cluster, merge, or split source Layouts into output families. |
| `mirror` | Restore source pages, inheritance, placeholders, native objects, and visuals from the lossless import. Do not simplify, redesign, rename structure, or infer new common structure. |

**Hard rule — restoration is mechanical**: Mirror may normalize namespaces,
portable asset paths, explicit root declarations, and fixed-layer group wrappers
required by the current compiler. Expanding a source Master/Layout group must
produce direct atoms with the same ownership, transforms, paint order, and
appearance. A maintainability preference is not authority to alter the source
template.

### 2.2 Native Shape Payload and Authoring Projection

| Representation | Purpose | Payload rule |
|---|---|---|
| Lossless import SVG | Round-trip and mirror-restoration source | Retain complete imported metadata, native object boundaries, hidden carriers, and source-scope identity. It is authoritative for mirror restoration. |
| Lightweight authoring projection | Model-readable inspection surface | Omit opaque native payload and duplicate hidden carriers from model context; retain visible shape intent and logical ids needed to locate an adopted object in the lossless import |
| `standard` / `fidelity` output | Newly authored contract | Use compact canonical metadata for new shapes. Reuse exported image/vector assets, not opaque source shape payload or source topology. |
| `mirror` output | Restored contract | Keep currently supported imported metadata on unchanged Slide-local/slot objects. Normalize fixed structural layers into direct atoms from the lossless source. The projection never becomes the restoration source. |

**Validation**: Mirror does not silently use stale metadata or a lightweight
projection. If an imported object cannot use the converter's supported native
metadata after normalization, keep its current SVG fallback and report the
limitation. `standard` / `fidelity` regenerate compact canonical shapes instead
of transplanting opaque source payload. `data-pptx-native` remains reserved for
native chart/table markers.

**Explicit template SVG contract**:

| Authored/restored fact | Template SVG declaration |
|---|---|
| Master/Layout identity | Root `data-pptx-master` / `data-pptx-master-name` plus `data-pptx-layout` / `data-pptx-layout-name`; authored keys for `standard` / `fidelity`, source keys for `mirror` |
| Authored Master/Layout visual | In `standard` / `fidelity`, use a direct atomic child with `data-pptx-layer="master|layout"` and `data-pptx-editable="false"`; `<g>` is forbidden for a structural layer |
| Restored Master/Layout visual | In `mirror`, recursively expand each fixed-layer source group into direct atoms with the same Master/Layout ownership, transforms, styles, paint order, and appearance; semantic regrouping is forbidden |
| Content slot | Direct `<g id>` with `data-pptx-placeholder` and explicit `data-pptx-placeholder-bounds`; `standard` / `fidelity` author the slot, while `mirror` preserves source type/index/bounds and carrier identity |
| Page-only background | Direct full-canvas solid rect with `data-pptx-layer="slide"` |
| Structural page-frame hint | Optional `data-pptx-role` only when background/decoration/header/footer/logo/watermark/chrome/page-number behavior is not already expressed by layer/placeholder metadata; stable unique `id` required |

Repeat inherited visuals in every standalone SVG so browser preview remains complete. Template export validates their equality and restores or creates the declared Master/Layout parts. It does not infer ownership.

**Forbidden — legacy structure contract**: Do not carry `data-pptx-layout-kind`, `distilled`, `utility`, unmapped `baseline`, `preserve`, or direct atomic placeholders into a reusable template package. Route that source through [`restore-pptx-structure`](../workflows/restore-pptx-structure.md) first.

**Composite slot boundary**: A normal slot group has exactly one compatible direct carrier. Only a genuinely composite region may declare `data-pptx-placeholder="object"` with `data-pptx-placeholder-binding="proxy"`; the visible group stays Slide-local and export creates a hidden transparent binding proxy. Do not use proxy binding as the default template slot form.

In `mirror`, preserve imported placeholder types, indices, bounds, and carrier
identity exactly when the importer supports them. Do not replace source
`subTitle`, `obj`, `media`, or `dt` roles with generic body content. In
`standard` / `fidelity`, assign the canonical authored types deliberately:
`title`, `subtitle`, `body`, `picture`, `chart`, `table`, `object`, `media`,
`date`, `footer`, and `slide-number`. An authored title normally has no index;
assign stable indices only when repeated roles need disambiguation inside the
new Layout.

**Hard rule — explicit design-zone bounds**: Every slot carries `data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="x y width height"`. Mirror uses the source Layout placeholder frame. `standard` / `fidelity` author bounds from the intended safe area, column, panel inset, or media frame. Do not use character count, glyph width, current wrapping, or the tight sample-content box. An authored Layout may intentionally have zero slots.

### 3. Placeholder Markers

> Mirror retains literal source example text and source placeholder metadata. It does not insert `{{...}}` markers. The rest of this section defines the preferred authoring vocabulary for standard and fidelity modes.

Use clear placeholder markers for replaceable content:

```xml
<!-- Text slot -->
<g id="title-slot" data-pptx-placeholder="title"
   data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="80 280 1120 96">
  <text id="title-carrier" data-pptx-placeholder-carrier="true"
        x="80" y="320" fill="#FFFFFF" font-size="48" font-weight="bold">
    {{TITLE}}
  </text>
</g>

<!-- Content area placeholder (content page only) -->
<rect x="40" y="90" width="1200" height="550" fill="#FFFFFF" rx="8"/>
<g id="body-slot" data-pptx-placeholder="body"
   data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="40 90 1200 550">
  <text id="body-carrier" data-pptx-placeholder-carrier="true"
        x="640" y="365" text-anchor="middle" fill="#CBD5E1" font-size="16">
    {{CONTENT_AREA}}
  </text>
</g>
```

### 4. Placeholder Reference (canonical convention, overridable per template)

This is the **default vocabulary** used across template packages. Newly created templates SHOULD prefer these names so downstream projects find familiar slots; designers MAY substitute or extend them when a style genuinely needs different vocabulary (e.g. consulting decks lead with `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` instead of `{{PAGE_TITLE}}`; a brand cover may need `{{BRAND_LOGO}}`).

`svg_quality_checker.py --template-mode` emits **advisory warnings** when a page lacks the conventional placeholder for its type. To silence those warnings — and document the template's actual contract — declare a `placeholders:` map in `design_spec.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
placeholders:
  01_cover: ["{{TITLE}}", "{{SUBTITLE}}", "{{BRAND_LOGO}}"]
  03_content: ["{{KEY_MESSAGE}}", "{{CONTENT_AREA}}"]
  03a_content_dual_col: []   # explicitly assert "no required placeholders"
```

| Placeholder | Purpose | Applicable page | Convention role |
|------------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `{{TITLE}}` | Main title | Cover | Default |
| `{{SUBTITLE}}` | Subtitle | Cover | Default |
| `{{DATE}}` | Date | Cover | Default |
| `{{AUTHOR}}` | Author / Organization | Cover | Default |
| `{{CHAPTER_NUM}}` | Chapter number | Chapter page | Default |
| `{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}` | Chapter title | Chapter page | Default |
| `{{CHAPTER_DESC}}` | Chapter description | Chapter page | Optional |
| `{{PAGE_TITLE}}` | Page title | Content page | Default |
| `{{CONTENT_AREA}}` | Content area | Content page | Default |
| `{{PAGE_NUM}}` | Page number | Content page, ending page | Default |
| `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` | Key takeaway | Content page (consulting style) | Style-specific |
| `{{SECTION_NAME}}` | Section name | Content page footer | Optional |
| `{{SOURCE}}` | Data source | Content page footer | Optional |
| `{{THANK_YOU}}` | Thank-you message | Ending page | Default |
| `{{CONTACT_INFO}}` | Contact info | Ending page | Default |
| `{{ENDING_SUBTITLE}}` | Ending subtitle | Ending page | Optional |
| `{{CLOSING_MESSAGE}}` | Closing message | Ending page | Style-specific |
| `{{COPYRIGHT}}` | Copyright | Ending page | Optional |

For TOC pages in **newly created templates**, use indexed placeholders:

- `{{TOC_ITEM_1_TITLE}}`, `{{TOC_ITEM_1_DESC}}`
- `{{TOC_ITEM_2_TITLE}}`, `{{TOC_ITEM_2_DESC}}`
- ...

Do **not** create new TOC placeholder families such as `{{CHAPTER_01_TITLE}}` for new templates. Existing templates may contain legacy placeholder variants, but new output should converge on the indexed TOC contract.

Variants reuse their parent type's placeholder set by default: every `03*_content*.svg` shares the content placeholder list above, unless the spec frontmatter declares an override for that specific stem.

For `standard` / `fidelity`, canonical placeholder insertion takes priority over visual mimicry; adjust the newly designed layout or declare an intentional vocabulary override. Mirror preserves the source placeholders and literal text instead of inserting canonical authoring markers.

## Output Requirements

### File Save Location

Both scopes use one complete workspace shape. Only the workspace root differs:

| Scope | `<template_workspace>` |
|---|---|
| `library` | `skills/ppt-master/templates/<kind_dir>/<template_name>/` |
| `project` | `<target_project>/` |

Standard mode (default):

```
<template_workspace>/
├── templates/
│   ├── design_spec.md
│   ├── 01_cover.svg
│   ├── 02_chapter.svg
│   ├── 02_toc.svg              # Optional

Mirror mode emits one SVG per source slide, named by source order:

```
<template_workspace>/templates/
├── design_spec.md
├── 001_cover.svg
├── 002_toc.svg
├── 003_content.svg
├── 004_content.svg
├── 005_chapter.svg
├── 006_content.svg
├── ...
├── 049_content.svg
└── 050_ending.svg
```

Filenames preserve the source slide order via the 3-digit prefix; `<page_type>` is derived from `manifest.json` `pageTypeCandidates`. Literal source text and the source native structure are restored; the lightweight projection is not copied into the output.

**Hard rule — common routing**: Keep `design_spec.md`, template SVGs, and non-bitmap template-source assets in `templates/`; place every bitmap in `images/`; duplicate each extracted icon into `templates/icons/` and runtime `icons/`. Write a review deck to `exports/` only when explicitly requested. Create optional directories only when they contain real files; never add placeholders for empty directories. Do not branch asset placement by output scope.

### Template Preview

When the user requests a PowerPoint review file, run `template_preview_pptx.py <template_workspace>` after SVG validation. The command creates `exports/` on demand and verifies one slide per SVG prototype plus the expected Master/Layout counts. The first export refuses a collision; an intentional post-fix replacement uses `--force`. The review PPTX is derived evidence and never a template-application input.

When a review deck was generated, include its path in the completion summary. Otherwise omit `exports/` from the workspace inventory.

If the template is based on PPTX import output, briefly note:
- which extracted assets were reused directly
- for `standard` / `fidelity`, which visual references influenced the newly authored roster
- for `mirror`, whether any source feature could not be restored and the exact affected source object/page
- whether any page-type filename mapping required judgment beyond the import heuristic

## Using Pre-built Template Library (Optional)

If suitable template resources already exist, use them directly instead of generating new ones:

1. **Copy template workspace**: copy or stage `templates/` plus any existing `images/` and `icons/`; exclude `exports/` from template application.
2. **Adjust colors**: Modify colors per the project design spec
3. **Customize**: Make project-specific adjustments

This section describes downstream reuse of an existing workspace. Library and project scopes carry the same portable template contract.

**Example library structure** (query the appropriate kind's index — `templates/layouts/layouts_index.json` for structure-only templates, `templates/decks/decks_index.json` for complete identity + structure templates, `templates/brands/brands_index.json` for identity-only presets):

```
templates/
├── brands/
│   ├── anthropic/         # Anthropic brand identity (logo + colors + typography)
│   └── google/            # Google brand identity
├── layouts/
│   ├── academic_defense/  # Academic-defense structure (no identity)
│   └── pixel_retro/       # Pixel retro / cyberpunk structure (no identity)
└── decks/
    ├── <bank_deck>/        # Example banking deck
    └── <engineering_deck>/ # Example engineering deck
```

## Phase Completion Checkpoint

```markdown
## Template_Designer Phase Complete

- [x] Read `references/template-designer.md`
- [x] Output scope confirmed: `library` | `project`; the common workspace preflight passed before final writes
- [x] Replication mode confirmed: `standard` | `fidelity` | `mirror`
- [x] Every page listed in `design_spec.md §V Page Roster` saved to `<template_workspace>/templates/`
- [x] Naming convention applied (standard / fidelity: letter-suffix variants; mirror: `<NNN>_<page_type>.svg`)
- [x] Templates follow design spec (colors, fonts, layout)
- [x] `standard` / `fidelity` SVGs and Master/Layout contracts were newly authored; `mirror` SVGs restore the lossless source graph without semantic redesign
- [x] Placeholder markers are clear and standardized for `standard` / `fidelity`; mirror preserves literal source text plus source placeholder type/index/bounds
- [x] Every SVG is a complete preview with explicit root Master/Layout identity and `native_structure_mode: structured`; authored modes use canonical fixed layers/slots, while mirror preserves source ownership and mechanically expands fixed-layer groups into direct atoms
- [x] Authored `standard` / `fidelity` Layout keys are non-duplicative; mirror keeps distinct source Layout identities even when their current visible contracts are equivalent
- [x] Model context used lightweight projections; lossless imports remained authoritative for mirror restoration, while `standard` / `fidelity` used compact canonical authored metadata
- [x] Both scopes route bitmaps to `images/` and copy extracted icons to both `templates/icons/` and runtime `icons/`
- [ ] **Next step**: Validate assets, optionally export a review PPTX, then register only library scope
```
