## REQUIRED: Read Full Documentation First

**Before using playwriter, you MUST run this command:**

```bash
playwriter skill
```

This outputs the complete documentation including:
- Session management and timeout configuration
- Selector strategies (and which ones to AVOID)
- Rules to prevent timeouts and failures
- Best practices for slow pages and SPAs
- Context variables, utility functions, and more

**Do NOT skip this step.** The quick examples below will fail without understanding timeouts, selector rules, and common pitfalls from the full docs.

## Minimal Example (after reading full docs)

```bash
playwriter session new
playwriter -s 1 -e "await page.goto('https://example.com')"
```

If `playwriter` is not found, use `npx playwriter@latest` or `bunx playwriter@latest`.
