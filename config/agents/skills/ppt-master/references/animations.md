# Page Transitions & Per-Element Animations

PPT Master's exported PPTX supports **page transitions** and **per-element
entrance animations** as real PowerPoint OOXML. Other applications may
interpret timing differently; this contract makes no unconditional Keynote guarantee.

## 1. Defaults

| Layer | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Page transition | CLI: `fade`, 0.4s | Calm baseline that suits most decks; the public Python builder retains its legacy 0.5s default |
| Per-element animation | **`none` (off)** | A page appears as a whole. Auto-firing element builds are an unsolicited "AI deck" tell, so element entrance is opt-in. Turn it on with `-a auto` (or another effect): effects map from group id (chart→wipe, card-/step-/pillar-→fly, title/takeaway→fade); image-like ids (`hero` / `figure-` / `image` / `img-` / `kpi`) cycle a richer visual pool (zoom / dissolve / circle / box / diamond / wheel) so multiple images vary across the deck; unmatched ids cycle a small fade/wipe/fly/zoom pool |

To regenerate a deck with different settings, rerun `svg_to_pptx.py` against the same `svg_output/` — no need to rerun the LLM. `-s final` is reserved for diagnostic comparison and is not a supported release source. To turn per-element animation on for the whole deck, pass `-a auto`.

---

## 2. Custom Object-Level Animation

Per-element animation is off by default. To enable it deck-wide, pass `-a auto` at export (no config needed). When a deck instead needs specific object timing — for example title first, chart second, annotation last — use the optional `animations.json` sidecar. The SVG remains static visual source; the sidecar only controls PPTX export behavior.

Run the standalone [`customize-animations`](../workflows/customize-animations.md) workflow when the user asks to tune animation order, effects, timing, or object-level reveals.

```bash
# Build an editable scaffold from real top-level <g id> anchors
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py scaffold <project>

# Validate references before export
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py validate <project>

# Export reads <project>/animations.json automatically when present
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project>
```

Single-slide sidecar excerpt (repeat the complete slide block for every SVG in `svg_output/`):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "defaults": {
    "transition": { "effect": "fade", "duration": 0.4 },
    "animation": { "effect": "auto", "duration": 0.4, "stagger": 0.5, "trigger": "after-previous" }
  },
  "slides": {
    "03_market": {
      "transition": { "effect": "fade", "duration": 0.4 },
      "animation": { "effect": "auto", "duration": 0.4, "stagger": 0.5, "trigger": "after-previous" },
      "groups": {
        "title": { "effect": "fade", "order": 1 },
        "chart": { "effect": "wipe", "order": 2, "duration": 0.6 },
        "insight": { "effect": "fly", "order": 3, "delay": 0.2 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `slides` keys match SVG stems (`03_market.svg` → `03_market`).
- `groups` keys match top-level `<g id="...">` anchors.
- `effect: none` removes that group from the entrance sequence.
- `order` changes animation order only; it does not change slide layering.
- `delay` is seconds before that group starts in `after-previous` mode.
- `duration` overrides the per-group schedule duration. `appear` remains a 1ms visibility flip; its configured duration spaces the next `after-previous` row.
- `--animation none` overrides the sidecar and disables all per-element animation.
- An explicit sidecar group may override the legacy chrome-name heuristic, but it cannot override `data-pptx-layer` or an explicit static role/placeholder marker.
- Unknown effects, modes, or triggers and invalid numeric/order fields fail validation; no fallback effect is substituted.

## 3. Page Transitions

```bash
# Pick a different effect
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t push --transition-duration 0.6

# Remove the visual transition
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t none

# Auto-advance every 5 seconds (kiosk-style playback)
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> --auto-advance 5

# Auto-advance with no visual transition
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t none --auto-advance 5
```

Available effects: `fade`, `push`, `wipe`, `split`, `strips`, `cover`, `random`.

Flags:

- `-t/--transition` — effect name, or `none` for no visual transition. Default: `fade`. `none` does not remove an explicitly configured automatic advance.
- `--transition-duration` — seconds, default `0.4`.
- `--auto-advance` — seconds; click remains enabled, so the slide advances on click or when the timer expires. Omit for presenter-controlled advance.

**Hard rule — no silent downgrade**: an unknown transition effect or invalid/non-finite duration fails export. It is never replaced by `fade`. Recorded narration keeps the resolved visual transition; `-t none --recorded-narration ...` writes narration-driven advance timing without restoring a visual effect.

## 4. Per-Element Animations

Off by default — enable deck-wide with `-a auto` (or another effect). Once enabled, three Start modes are available — these mirror PowerPoint's animation-pane "Start" dropdown:

- **`on-click`** — entering a slide → first click reveals the first semantic group; each subsequent click reveals the next group in z-order. Suits live presentations where the speaker paces reveals. Forbidden with `--recorded-narration` because video-ready exports need click-free playback.
- **`with-previous`** — all groups start together on slide entry, playing their entrance animation in parallel. Stagger ignored.
- **`after-previous`** (default) — first group fires on slide entry, subsequent groups cascade after the previous one finishes, with `--animation-stagger` extra spacing. Suits kiosk playback, recorded walkthroughs, or anyone who wants visual flow without clicking.

```bash
# Default behavior (no flags): page transitions only, no per-element builds
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project>

# Enable per-element animation deck-wide (auto effect + after-previous cascade)
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -a auto

# Enable with a single effect (cascades via the after-previous trigger)
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> --animation fade

# Enable and switch to on-click for live presentations (presenter controls pacing)
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -a auto --animation-trigger on-click

# Custom pacing
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> --animation mixed \
        --animation-stagger 0.7 --animation-duration 0.5

# All groups animate in unison on slide entry
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -a auto --animation-trigger with-previous
```

22 single effects: `appear`, `fade`, `fly`, `cut`, `zoom`, `wipe`, `split`, `blinds`, `checkerboard`, `dissolve`, `random_bars`, `peek`, `wheel`, `box`, `circle`, `diamond`, `plus`, `strips`, `wedge`, `stretch`, `expand`, `swivel`. Plus three auto-vary modes:

These names preserve the established filter / `presetID` / `presetSubtype` tuples documented in [`pptx-animations.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md#3-compatibility-contract). `cut` is a legacy public key; compatibility promises its existing tuple, not a semantic interpretation inferred from an external preset-id table.

- `auto` (recommended when enabling) — map effect from the group's SVG id. Information-dense elements get a single stable effect: `chart` / `table` / `legend` / `timeline` / `track` → `wipe`; `card-*` / `pillar-*` / `item-*` / `step-*` / `stage-*` / `tier-*` / `principle-*` → `fly`; `title` / `chapter-*` / `section-*` / `cover-*` / `tagline` / `subtitle` → `fade`; `takeaway` / `callout` / `quote` / `source` / `conclusion` / `note` → `fade`. Image-like ids `hero` / `figure-*` / `image` / `img-*` / `kpi` instead cycle a richer visual pool (`zoom` / `dissolve` / `circle` / `box` / `diamond` / `wheel`) so multiple images vary across the deck. Unmatched ids cycle through `fade` / `wipe` / `fly` / `zoom`.
- `mixed` (legacy) — deterministic. The first animated group on each slide uses `fade`; later groups cycle through a 16-effect pool (`blinds` / `checkerboard` / `dissolve` / `fly` / `cut` / `random_bars` / `box` / `split` / `strips` / `wedge` / `wheel` / `wipe` / `expand` / `fade` / `swivel` / `zoom`) across the deck. Kept for backward compatibility.
- `random` — samples from the legacy 16-effect pool. Resolution is seeded from the effective deck input, so the same input produces the same choices; `--conversion-trace` records every resolved effect when diagnostics are enabled.

`appear` is excluded from every variation pool because it has no visible motion.

Flags:

- `-a/--animation` — effect name, `auto`, `mixed`, `random`, or `none`. Default: `none` (per-element animation off; pass `auto` to enable).
- `--animation-trigger` — Start mode (matches PowerPoint): `on-click`, `with-previous`, or `after-previous` (default).
- `--animation-duration` — per-element entrance seconds, default `0.4`.
- `--animation-stagger` — gap between elements in `after-previous` mode (seconds, default `0.5`). Ignored otherwise.
- `--animation-config` — sidecar path. Default: `<project>/animations.json` when present.

> Note: `--recorded-narration` rejects `on-click`; use `after-previous` or `with-previous` for video-ready narrated decks.

## 5. Anchor Logic — Top-Level `<g id="...">`

Per-element animations are anchored on **top-level `<g id="...">` content groups** in the SVG (e.g. `<g id="cover-title">`, `<g id="card-1">`). One group produces one animation-pane entrance row; whether that row needs a click depends on the selected Start mode.

Aim for **3–8 content groups per slide**. This is also the granularity PowerPoint uses for group-select / group-move, so it improves editing ergonomics regardless of animation.

**Chrome groups skip the cascade automatically.** Explicit SVG role and placeholder semantics are authoritative. A group with `data-pptx-layer` or an explicit static role/placeholder marker can never animate. For marker-free legacy SVGs only, top-level groups whose id tokens look like page chrome (background, header/footer, decorations, watermark, page number, nav, logo, dividing rule) are excluded and appear with the slide. An explicit `animations.json` group entry may override this id-name heuristic, but never an explicit structural marker. Examples that auto-skip by legacy id: `<g id="background">`, `<g id="bg-texture">`, `<g id="cover-footer">`, `<g id="p03-header">`, `<g id="bottom-decor">`, `<g id="watermark">`, `<g id="nav">`, `<g id="logo-area">`, `<g id="column-rule">`. Examples that still animate: `<g id="card-1">`, `<g id="cover-title">`, `<g id="step-discover">`, `<g id="timeline-track">`. Do not strip the `<g>` wrapper to avoid animation — keep it for PowerPoint group selection and use `effect: none` when the content should remain static.

**Fallback for flat SVGs** (no top-level `<g>` wrappers, only raw `<rect>` / `<text>` / `<path>` at the root):

- ≤ 8 visible top-level primitives → each becomes one anchor (capped to avoid 70+ atom cascades on dense pages).
- > 8 → animation is skipped on that slide. The slide still renders, just without entrance animation.

Executors should wrap logical sections in `<g id>` regardless of whether you plan to animate. The Executor reference (`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md`) requires it.

## 6. Validation and Read-Back

Animation configuration is strict. Export fails on an unknown effect, mode, or trigger; a boolean or non-finite duration/delay/stagger; a non-positive duration; a negative delay/stagger; a non-positive or non-integer order; a missing slide/group reference; or any attempt to animate a structural layer. These errors never downgrade to another effect or silently omit a requested target.

Generated export reads each slide's timing tree back and checks row count/order, trigger, shape target, resolved effect tuple, duration, and timeline offset. Package validation then checks root timing placement, unique and valid `p:cTn` ids, and every `p:spTgt` reference. The writer does not emit `p:bldP` for groups or pictures. Direct-PPTX preserve mode tolerates unchanged legacy group/picture `p:bldP` rows from earlier PPT Master exports; new generated packages remain strict.

Narration injection merges audio timing into an existing direct `p:sld/p:timing` DOM and preserves entrance rows. A source timing tree nested in `mc:AlternateContent` or another non-root container fails safely instead of being rewritten or duplicated. Direct-PPTX routes fingerprint source object-animation timing before and after their allowed edits, then run structural package validation; they do not author or normalize animation effects.

---

## 7. Limitations

- **Native DrawingML output only.** Page transitions and per-element animations are authored on the PPTX produced by the project converter from `svg_output/`. `svg_final/` remains a static SVG visual preview, not an animated or alternate PPTX route.
- **PowerPoint OOXML scope.** Effects preserve their established filter / `presetID` / `presetSubtype` tuples and are validated against the serialized PowerPoint package. Rendering in Keynote, LibreOffice, WPS, or other applications is outside the unconditional compatibility guarantee.
- **Manual SVG shape conversion is unsupported.** Inserting an `svg_final/` page as an SVG picture does not establish element animation anchors; use the native PPTX when editable animated shapes are required.
- **Source extension preservation.** Direct-PPTX routes preserve unknown transition `AlternateContent` when configured to keep the source. When advance timing changes, Choice and Fallback receive the same `advClick` / `advTm` values.
