# SVG Pipeline Tools

> Architecture rationale (why each artifact / step exists, deletion impact, two-consumer relationship between `svg_finalize/` and native pptx conversion): see [docs/technical-design.md "Post-Processing Pipeline"](../../../../docs/technical-design.md#post-processing-pipeline).

These tools cover post-processing, SVG validation, speaker notes, recorded narration, and PPTX export.

The supported delivery contract has one PPTX path: `svg_output/` → the project SVG-to-DrawingML converter → native PPTX. The mandatory `finalize_svg.py` step separately creates self-contained `svg_final/` visual previews, which may be opened directly or inserted into PowerPoint as SVG pictures. There is no SVG-image PPTX output, and PowerPoint's manual Convert-to-Shape operation is unsupported.

## `svg_authoring_view.py`

Create a lightweight inspection/authoring projection of one PPTX-imported SVG
or a directory of imported SVGs:

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_authoring_view.py <svg-file-or-directory> -o <output-dir>
```

The operation is non-destructive and refuses existing output files unless
`--force` is explicit. It never writes back to the source SVG. The JSON report
on stdout records original/projected byte counts and removals by category.

The projected copy:

- removes embedded `txbody` metadata;
- removes hidden native geometry carriers while retaining and unwrapping their
  visible preview geometry;
- removes source-object identity/style/hash attributes that are only useful to
  an exact import round trip;
- keeps visible paths, text, images, stable ids, Master/Layout root markers,
  and supported compact `data-pptx-object` / `data-pptx-prst` /
  `data-pptx-frame` intent; and
- rewrites relative local asset references for the projection's new location.

The complete imported SVG remains the evidence source for mirror restoration.
The exporter does not read the import workspace or the projection. The
projection is deliberately not a template generator, not a replacement for
the explicit Master/Layout restoration workflow, and not a supported release
input to `svg_to_pptx.py`.

## Recommended Pipeline

Run these steps in order:

```bash
python3 scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
python3 scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
```

## `finalize_svg.py`

Unified post-processing entry point. This is the preferred way to run SVG cleanup.

It aggregates:
- `embed_icons.py`
- static same-document `<use>` expansion from `svg_to_pptx/use_expander.py`
- `align_embed_images.py` (`crop-images` / `fix-aspect` / `embed-images` aliases route here)
- `flatten_tspan.py`

`svg_final/` remains a required Step 7.2 artifact even though the native exporter reads `svg_output/`. It is the self-contained visual reference and may be manually inserted as an SVG picture.

## `svg_to_pptx.py`

Convert project SVGs into PPTX.

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --native-objects
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --pptx-structure structured  # deck/layout template override
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --pptx-structure flat  # free-design/brand-only override
# Template-import visual round-trip diagnostic only:
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <template_import_output> -s svg-flat
# Post-processed-source comparison diagnostic only (never a release export):
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> -s final
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --no-notes
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> -t none
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --auto-advance 3
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --animation mixed --animation-duration 0.8
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --no-merge   # strict line-fidelity mode (see below)
python3 scripts/notes_to_audio.py <project_path> --voice zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --recorded-narration audio
```

Behavior:
- Default output (default-flow mode, no `-o`):
  - `exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx` — native editable pptx (canonical output)
  - `backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/` — copy of Executor SVG source, always written so the pptx can be rebuilt via `finalize_svg → svg_to_pptx` without re-running the LLM
- `finalize_svg.py` always creates `svg_final/` before export. This directory is the self-contained SVG visual preview; it is not packaged as a second PPTX.
- Explicit `-o/--output` changes the native PPTX destination and skips `backup/`.
- Paragraph merging is enabled by default and trades some SVG line-layout fidelity for PowerPoint editability:
  - Default: mergeable paragraph blocks (same x, dy clustered around one base line-height) collapse into one editable text frame. Equal effective font sizes may join as flowing prose; a font-size change, list marker, or accepted larger gap starts a new `<a:p>` with precise `<a:lnSpc>` / `<a:spcBef>`. Resizing the box reflows text inside it without erasing those paragraph boundaries.
  - With `--no-merge`: every dy-stacked `<tspan>` becomes its own text frame — exact SVG line layout is preserved but a 12-line paragraph is 12 separate textboxes
  - Side effect: PowerPoint may wrap merged paragraphs to a different line count than the SVG source. Long body text (abstracts, multi-paragraph sections, reference lists) usually benefits from the default; pages with tight typographic alignment (covers, charts, tables) usually want `--no-merge`
  - Mergeable detection is conservative: only fires when the children form a clean paragraph block; mixed-layout `<text>` falls through to the default per-line path
- Native release export reads `svg_output/`. `-s final` is an explicit diagnostic override for comparing conversion behavior against post-processed SVGs; it does not change artifact ownership or create a supported release path.
- `svg_final/` may be opened directly or inserted into PowerPoint as an SVG picture. PowerPoint's manual Convert-to-Shape operation is outside the compatibility contract.
- On every SVG-authoring route, each file in `svg_output/` is the complete visible
  page-design source. Templates and locks may guide authoring, but finalize/export
  never use them to overlay visible content missing from the SVG. Notes, animation,
  narration, transitions, and direct native-PPTX workflows keep their separate
  inputs and package-level processing.
- For PPTX template-import workspaces, use `-s svg-flat` when you need a visual round-trip check. The layered `svg/` tree is the machine-readable template source and intentionally does not inline inherited master / layout decoration into each slide.
- Native mode is strict about unsupported visual SVG elements: if a visual element cannot be represented or safely preserved, export fails with the SVG file, element tag, and position instead of silently dropping content.
- Omitting `--pptx-structure` reads `spec_lock.md`. Free-design and brand-only releases declare `mode: flat`, omit Master/Layout mappings and SVG structure metadata, and use PowerPoint's default Master plus Blank Layout. Deck/layout template releases declare `mode: structured` with a complete `pptx_masters` roster and one `pptx_layouts` row per page.
- On structured template routes, every page root repeats Master/Layout keys and picker names. Master/Layout fixed visuals are direct atomic children; layer `<g>` elements are invalid.
- On structured template routes, each normal slot is a direct root `<g id>` with semantic type, positive design-zone bounds, and exactly one compatible carrier. Composite `object` slots use explicit proxy binding; zero-slot Layouts are valid. Flat pages keep all SVG objects Slide-local.
- Structured export maps locked typography/colors into PowerPoint Master/Layout/theme defaults, creates one reusable Layout per declared key, and reopens the package to verify the full Presentation → Master → Layout → Slide graph, fixed-object order, placeholder identities/bounds, carrier bindings, hidden proxies, and zero-slot Layouts.
- Template `page_layouts` remains input provenance. Strict preserves the prototype contract; adaptive retains its Master and may use a new Layout identity only when fixed Layout atoms or slot topology/bounds change.
- Legacy structured/template contracts using `baseline`, `template`, `preserve`, `layout_strategy`, `data-pptx-layout-kind`, `distilled`/`utility`, direct atomic placeholders, or incomplete Master identity are rejected with a pointer to [`restore-pptx-structure`](../../workflows/restore-pptx-structure.md). Explicit flat free-design/brand-only projects intentionally omit Master identity.
- Native output uses content-hash media filenames, so identical images are reused and different images cannot overwrite each other by sharing a basename.
- `[Content_Types].xml` is generated from the actual media extensions written into the PPTX. Unknown media extensions fail unless Python's `mimetypes` can identify them.
- Native export writes to a temporary file first and publishes the requested PPTX only after conversion succeeds. A failed conversion does not replace the main output file.
- Before publishing structured template output, export reopens the temporary PPTX and validates the Slide → Layout → Master graph and registrations, Layout identity, placeholder identity, reusable bounds, and prompt/level-one sizes. A mismatch aborts publication. Flat release output intentionally skips this structured graph gate.
- SVG clip paths are still restricted for authored SVGs, but nested crop wrappers generated by PPTX import are mapped back to native picture crop / geometry when possible.
- Speaker notes are embedded automatically unless `--no-notes` is used
- Recorded narration is opt-in:
  - `notes_to_audio.py` uses `edge-tts` by default, or a configured cloud TTS provider (`elevenlabs`, `minimax`, `qwen`, `cosyvoice`), and generates one audio file per slide into `audio/`
  - Narration text is read strictly from the matching `notes/*.md` file; the script only skips Markdown heading lines (`# ...`) and does not summarize, rewrite, or filter delivery notes
  - `--recorded-narration audio` prepares PowerPoint's "recorded timings and narrations": every slide must have matching `m4a` / `mp3` / `wav` audio, `ffprobe` must read every duration, and `--animation-trigger on-click` is rejected
  - `--recorded-narration audio` keeps speaker notes, embeds each matching audio file, and writes slide auto-advance timings from audio duration
  - Narration timing is merged into the existing slide timing DOM; object entrance rows and the resolved page transition are preserved rather than regenerated
  - `--narration-audio-dir audio` is the lower-level embedding path: it embeds whatever files match and allows partial audio coverage
  - Either narration flag names the default-flow export `<project_name>_<timestamp>_narrated.pptx`, telling it apart from silent exports in the same directory
  - This is intended for direct PowerPoint video export with "Use recorded timings and narrations"
  - Long-audio import and automatic long-audio splitting are not supported; keep narration assets page-level
  - Voice choices can be listed with `python3 scripts/notes_to_audio.py --list-common-voices`, `python3 scripts/notes_to_audio.py --list-voices --locale zh-CN`, or provider-specific `--provider <name> --list-voices`
- Page transitions are controlled by `-t/--transition`; per-element entrance animations are controlled by `-a/--animation`
- Per-element animation applies to ordinary top-level SVG `<g id="...">` groups in z-order; aim for 3–8 Slide-local content groups per slide. Master/Layout atoms and slot groups are structural and excluded; exact id tokens remain a fallback only when explicit structural roles are absent
- An explicit `animations.json` group entry may override the marker-free legacy chrome-name heuristic. It cannot override `data-pptx-layer` or an explicit static role/placeholder marker
- Start mode is set by `--animation-trigger`, mirroring PowerPoint's Start dropdown: `after-previous` (default, cascade with `--animation-stagger` spacing on slide entry), `on-click` (presenter-paced), `with-previous` (all together on slide entry)
- `on-click` is for live presentations only; recorded narration rejects it because the tool does not generate object-level click timings
- Flat SVG roots without top-level groups fall back to at most 8 visible primitives; beyond that, animation is skipped on the slide
- Per-element animation defaults to `none`. `auto` is opt-in (`-a auto`) and maps
  effects from the group's SVG id: information-dense elements get a stable
  effect (chart→wipe, card-/step-/pillar-→fly, title/takeaway→fade); image-like
  ids (hero/figure-/image/img-/kpi) cycle through a richer pool
  (zoom/dissolve/circle/box/diamond/wheel), while unmatched ids cycle through
  fade/wipe/fly/zoom.
- `mixed` (legacy) is deterministic: the first animated group on each slide uses `fade`, then later groups cycle through a larger 16-effect pool across the whole deck; `random` uses a stable seed from the effective deck input, and `--conversion-trace` records each resolved effect when enabled
- `--animation-duration` controls per-element entrance length (default `0.4`); `--animation-stagger` adds gap between elements in `after-previous` mode (default `0.5`)
- Optional object-level overrides live in `<project>/animations.json` or a path passed via `--animation-config`; build and validate them with `animation_config.py scaffold|validate`
- Animation configuration is strict: unknown effects/modes/triggers, invalid finite/range/order values, missing slides/groups, and structural-layer targets fail export without fallback or silent omission
- Generated export reads every slide back and verifies animation row order, trigger, shape target, resolved effect tuple, duration, and offset. Package validation then checks timing placement, `p:cTn` ids, and `p:spTgt` references before publication
- The animation writer does not emit `p:bldP` for groups or pictures. Direct-PPTX routes preserve source object animation and perform structural package validation only; they do not author effects
- The full registry, OOXML rules, and compatibility boundary are documented in [`pptx-animations.md`](./pptx-animations.md)

Dependency:

```bash
pip install python-pptx
```

## `total_md_split.py`

Split `total.md` into per-slide note files.

```bash
python3 scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
python3 scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path> -o <output_directory>
python3 scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path> -q
```

Requirements:
- Each section begins with `# `
- Heading text matches the SVG filename
- Sections are separated by `---`

## `svg_quality_checker.py`

Validate SVG technical compliance.

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py examples/project/svg_output/01_cover.svg
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py examples/project/svg_output
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py examples/project
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py examples/project --format ppt169
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py --all examples
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py examples/project --export
python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py path/to/template/templates --template-mode
```

Checks include:
- `viewBox`
- banned elements
- line-break structure
- explicit Master/Layout/slot structure for reusable templates
- duplicate empty Layout contracts under different keys

Template mode accepts compact canonical preset shapes marked with
`data-pptx-authoring="preset"`. It validates the explicit structured SVG
contract; it does not implement a separate source-payload opt-in marker.

## `svg_position_calculator.py`

Analyze and review supported chart coordinates after SVG generation.

Use this after `svg_quality_checker.py` passes, and only for chart types supported by this script: `bar`, `pie` / `donut`, `radar`, `line` / `area` / `scatter`, and `grid`. Area charts do not have a separate calculator mode: use `calc line` for the upper boundary points, then close the filled region to the plot area's bottom baseline (`y_max`) in the SVG.

### Calculate expected coordinates

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_position_calculator.py calc bar --data "A:185,B:142" --area "130,155,1200,480" --bar-width 120
python3 scripts/svg_position_calculator.py calc line --data "0:50,10:80,20:120" --area "120,120,1200,600" --y-range "0,150"
python3 scripts/svg_position_calculator.py calc pie --data "A:35,B:25,C:20" --center "420,400" --radius 200
python3 scripts/svg_position_calculator.py calc grid --rows 2 --cols 3 --area "50,150,1230,670"
```

For an area chart, use the line output as the top boundary:

```svg
M first_x,first_y ... L last_x,last_y L last_x,y_max L first_x,y_max Z
```

Manually compare the calculator output with the coordinates already present in the generated SVG. If coordinates differ, update the SVG from the `calc` output, rerun `svg_quality_checker.py`, then repeat the coordinate review. The tool intentionally does not rewrite SVG files automatically.

### Analyze (inspect existing SVG)

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_position_calculator.py analyze <svg_file>
```

Use this after SVG generation to inspect existing SVG geometry when manual comparison needs more context.

## Advanced Standalone Tools

### `flatten_tspan.py`

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/flatten_tspan.py examples/<project>/svg_output
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/flatten_tspan.py path/to/input.svg path/to/output.svg
```

### `align_embed_images.py`

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/align_embed_images.py path/to/slide.svg
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/align_embed_images.py --dry-run path/to/slide.svg
```

Use for rare single-file diagnostics when image `slice` / `meet` alignment and
Base64 embedding must be inspected outside `finalize_svg.py`. In normal project
runs, use `python3 scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>`; the old
`crop-images`, `fix-aspect`, and `embed-images` names remain accepted only as
`finalize_svg.py --only` aliases for the merged `align-images` step.

### `embed_icons.py`

```bash
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/embed_icons.py output.svg
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/embed_icons.py svg_output/*.svg
python3 scripts/svg_finalize/embed_icons.py --dry-run svg_output/*.svg
```

Replaces `<use data-icon="chunk-filled/name" .../>`, `<use data-icon="tabler-filled/name" .../>` and `<use data-icon="tabler-outline/name" .../>` placeholders with actual SVG path elements. Use for manual icon embedding checks outside `finalize_svg.py`.

## SVG Compatibility Contract

The canonical SVG authoring and native-mapping contract lives exclusively in
[`shared-standards.md`](../../references/shared-standards.md). This tool guide
does not repeat accepted syntax, rejected constructs, or conditional limits.

`svg_quality_checker.py` validates source SVG before finalization.
`finalize_svg.py` and native export apply the preprocessing required by that
contract, while native conversion fails on unsupported visual elements rather
than silently dropping them.
