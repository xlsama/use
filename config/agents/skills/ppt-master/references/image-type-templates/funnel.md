# Type: funnel

A **top-wide, bottom-narrow stack** of horizontal bands representing successive conversion stages. Each band is narrower than the one above it, suggesting attrition/filtering as the process progresses. The standard structural backbone for marketing funnels, sales pipelines, hiring funnels, customer-journey conversion.

> **What funnel means inside a PPT block**: a **converging-downward** stack — visual weight shrinks as you descend, embodying "many enter the top, few reach the bottom". Unlike `pyramid` (which can be either direction but typically narrows-upward for hierarchy/value), funnel is **always wide-to-narrow downward** and is about **filtering**, not hierarchy.

```
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐ ← Band 1 (widest)

| LAYOUT | 3-6 horizontal bands stacked vertically; each band's width decreases by ~15-25% from the band above |
| ELEMENTS | One simple iconic symbol per band (left side) + the band itself as the dominant color block. Optional thin divider lines between bands |
| NEGATIVE SPACE | Side margins grow as bands narrow — outer field on either side of the lower bands provides breathing room |
| BALANCE | Vertical center axis is the funnel's spine — all bands center-align to this axis |

## 2. Text-policy variants

### 3.1 `text_policy: none`

Each band shows an icon only; stage labels are handled in SVG.

Sample fragment:

> NO text, letters, numbers, or stage labels in the image. Each band contains only one simple iconic symbol; SVG text overlay will add stage names externally.

### 3.2 `text_policy: embedded`

Self-contained funnel diagram where band names are typeset into the artwork. Keep band names to single English words ("AWARE", "LIKE", "BUY", "REFER") in a font family echoing the deck's body typography. High failure risk on 5+ band funnels — stay at 3-4 bands when going embedded.

## 3. Fewshot prompt snippets

**Snippet A — vector-illustration + cool-corporate marketing funnel, text_policy: none, 600×800**

> Clean flat vector illustration of a marketing conversion funnel. Four horizontal bands stacked vertically, each band centered on the vertical axis and each ~20% narrower than the one above. Band 1 (top, widest): primary deep navy `#1E3A5F` solid fill, with a simple white megaphone icon centered on the left. Band 2: secondary lighter navy tint, with a heart icon. Band 3: accent gold `#D4AF37`, with a shopping-cart icon. Band 4 (bottom, narrowest): deeper accent gold, with a star icon. Each band has crisp straight edges and 8% drop shadow beneath. Thin secondary cream `#F8F9FA` dividers separate the bands. Background is calm secondary cream. Composed as a 600×800 portrait funnel block with 12% padding. NO text, letters, numbers, or stage labels anywhere — SVG will overlay all band names. Color values are rendering guidance only.
