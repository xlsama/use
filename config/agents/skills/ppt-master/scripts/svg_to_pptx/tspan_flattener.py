"""In-memory flattening of positional ``<tspan>`` elements.

DrawingML's text-run model has no way to express "jump to a new x/y inside
the same paragraph". Every ``<tspan>`` carrying ``x``, ``y`` or non-zero
``dy`` is therefore a layout instruction this converter cannot honour
inline — without flattening, a 4-line dy-stacked block collapses onto a
single baseline and an x-anchored tspan jumps to the wrong column.

The on-disk ``finalize_svg`` pipeline solves this by promoting each
positional tspan to an independent ``<text>`` element. This module
performs the same transformation in memory so ``svg_to_pptx`` can consume
``svg_output/`` directly without that disk step.

Public API:
    flatten_positional_tspans(tree) -> bool
        Walk the SVG element tree, replace every positional ``<tspan>``
        with an independent ``<text>``, and return whether anything
        changed.

Heavy lifting is delegated to ``svg_finalize.flatten_tspan`` so the two
pipelines stay behaviourally aligned.
